/// has its own failure shapes:
///
/// * a registry manifest that reads fine but does not deserialize —
///   `load_runtime_manifests` drops those silently, so a manifest written by an
///   older binary (`family_source`, `selected_artifact_url` and
///   `installed_at_unix_ms` carry no `#[serde(default)]`) vanishes from the
///   list and `current_runtime_manifest` misses;
/// * `active_runtime_key` naming a runtime whose manifest is not in the
///   registry at all;
/// * `default_runtime_id` matching no installed manifest — `runtime_id` is not
///   version-scoped, and `rocm config set-default-runtime` stores whatever it
///   is handed without validating it against the registry;
/// * `default_runtime_id` matching more than one installed manifest, which is
///   the ordinary state once two versions of the same family are installed,
///   because they share the one `therock-<channel>:<family>` id.
///   `current_runtime_manifest` resolves only an exactly-one match, so both the
///   zero-match and the multi-match shapes arrive here.
///
/// Every one of these is something `rocm runtimes list` already calls out, as
/// `active_status: missing manifest for active_runtime_key=...`,
/// `active_status: missing manifest for active_runtime_id=...` or
/// `active_status: ambiguous runtime_id=...`, so proceeding as a fresh install
