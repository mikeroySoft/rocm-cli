Feature: Runtime configuration

  # The acceptance criterion for the runtime-only default, kept engine-agnostic
  # on purpose: every GPU lane must check that a fresh install registers,
  # activates, still carries an inference engine, and omits the compiler
  # toolchain. Pinning this to one engine would drop that check on the lanes
  # where that engine is not the effective one.
  #
  # The last two Thens are the same fact from the two surfaces that can
  # disagree: what the install recorded, and what the diagnostic tells the user
  # it recorded. The toolchain is now something a user can end up without, so
  # `rocm examine` staying silent about it is its own defect.
  @id:runtime-install-sdk-active @requires-gpu @nightly
  Scenario: runtime-01 - Installing the SDK makes it the active runtime
    Given a machine with no CLI-managed runtimes
    When the user installs the SDK
    Then a runtime is registered
    And the runtime is set as active
    And the runtime includes an inference engine
    And the runtime excludes the compiler toolchain
    And the inspection reports the active runtime has no compiler toolchain

  # Dogfooding #17: re-provisioning was observed writing inside the previous
  # runtime, producing a recursively nested `runtimes/wheel/.../runtimes/wheel/`
  # path that bloats paths and breaks `services/*.log` globs. Assert the active
  # runtime's folder path has no such recursive segment. GPU-gated (needs a real
  # install so the folder path is populated).
  @id:runtime-path-not-nested @requires-gpu
  Scenario: runtime-02 - The managed runtime path is not nested inside another runtime
    Given a managed runtime is active
    When the user inspects the system
    Then the managed runtime folder path is not recursively nested

  # The SDK and the engine share one Python environment and both write torch into
  # it, so a second `install sdk` could leave a torch that one of the two cannot
  # use. Every health surface still reported `ready` and the install still exited
  # 0 — the first signal was a serve failure naming neither. The runtime now
  # settles on the SDK's build of the release the engine pins, so this asserts the
  # outcome that actually matters rather than the wording of a check: can the
  # runtime still reach the GPU afterwards. Needs a real SDK install, a real engine
  # install, and a second SDK install, so it runs on the nightly GPU lane.
  # `@requires-engine:vllm` because only vLLM shares the runtime environment;
  # Lemonade manages its own.
  #
  # The second Then is not a restatement of the first. A runtime the alignment never
  # touched can still open a device, so the device check alone cannot distinguish
  # "settled correctly" from "skipped entirely" — and skipping is the regression the
  # gate in front of the settle step would produce. Only the alignment block
  # separates them, and it is the one part of this path with no other e2e coverage.
  # It reads the block's verdict rather than one string, because a torch that has
  # already run a GPU kernel with this SDK is kept instead of rewritten and reports
  # a `retained_*` verdict — settled, with nothing installed.
  @id:runtime-sdk-reinstall-keeps-engine-consistent @requires-gpu @requires-engine:vllm @nightly
  Scenario: runtime-03 - Reinstalling the SDK leaves the installed engine able to use the GPU
    Given a managed runtime with an inference engine already installed
    When the user installs the SDK again
    Then the runtime can still use the GPU
    And the torch alignment settled rather than being skipped

  # `ROCM_CLI_DISABLE_TORCH_ALIGNMENT` is the exit for the machine where the stack
  # the alignment settles on — the SDK's build of the release the engine pins —
  # does not work. That stack is not validated against the supported matrix, and
  # the alignment runs on every path that installs an engine, so without the
  # opt-out a torch the user installed deliberately is replaced again by the next
  # command and the only remaining exit is to stop using the CLI.
  #
  # Nothing asserted it from the user's side. The unit tests reach the gate
  # directly, and a gate that is honoured in isolation but bypassed by the install
  # path around it looks identical to a working one from every surface a user can
  # see. This is the same reinstall as scenario 4 with the opt-out set, so what
  # differs between them is exactly the variable.
  #
  # Four claims across three Thens, because the opt-out is only coherent if all
  # four hold: torch was not rewritten; the skip is reported as its own verdict
  # rather than folded into the generic `not_applicable`, which would leave the
  # user unable to tell whether the variable did anything; the divergence the
  # opt-out deliberately leaves behind is not then sold back to that user as a
  # runtime to repair by reinstalling the engine — an instruction that would undo
  # what they asked for; and the checks the opt-out does not suppress still run,
  # because it suppresses the correction, not the diagnosis.
  #
  # Same lane as scenario 4 and for the same reasons: a real SDK install and a
  # real engine, on the serialized nightly GPU runners. `@requires-engine:vllm`
  # because only vLLM shares the runtime environment the alignment writes into.
  @id:runtime-torch-alignment-opt-out @requires-gpu @requires-engine:vllm @nightly
  Scenario: runtime-04 - Opting out of the torch alignment keeps the torch the user installed
    Given a managed runtime with an inference engine already installed
    And the user has opted out of realigning torch
    When the user installs the SDK again
    Then the torch alignment reports the opt-out instead of rewriting torch
    And the install does not offer to reinstall the engine over the kept torch
    And the runtime's device health is still reported

  # The GPU E2E lanes no longer install the shared runtime once and keep it
  # forever: `xtask e2e-prewarm` asks `rocm update` whether the channel index has
  # published a newer version, and installs it side-by-side when it has (EAI-8057).
  # That makes CI depend on the freshness line this scenario pins. A unit test on a
  # hand-written fixture cannot catch the renderer drifting away from the parser —
  # only running the real command can, which is why this is a scenario and not just
  # an xtask test. Cheap enough for the per-PR lanes: one CLI call against the
  # already-installed shared runtime. `status=error` is an ACCEPTED outcome, so an
  # offline runner reports honestly instead of flaking.
  @id:runtime-update-reports-freshness @requires-gpu
  Scenario: runtime-05 - The update check reports the active runtime's freshness
    Given a managed runtime is active
    When the user checks for runtime updates
    Then the report states the runtime's freshness against the channel index

  # The install used to record the path it was handed rather than the folder the
  # files land in, so reaching `data/runtimes` through a link made the runtime name
  # a folder that disappeared with the link — taking every console-script shebang
  # in the environment with it, while the files stayed where they were written
  # (rocm-cli#315). The E2E harness itself creates exactly that link when a scenario
  # opts into the shared pre-warmed runtime, so the shared tree on a runner was the
  # thing being poisoned. Previewing the install is enough to pin this and needs no
  # GPU and no download: the planned folder is resolved before the preview prints
  # it, so a regression shows up in the plan. `--family` is supplied because
  # without a GPU there is no target to detect.
  #
  # `@nightly` is not about this scenario's own cost — it runs in about eight
  # seconds, nearly all of it resolving the channel index. It is that the no-GPU
  # mock lane runs 64 scenarios at once, and that much concurrent network work is
  # enough to push `eai-7960-gen-tps-held-after-scrape-failure` and
  # `eai-7960-gen-tps-expiry-boundary` past the validity window they assert on
  # (measured: both fail 3/3 with this scenario on the mock lane, and pass with the
  # very same scenario once the suite is serialized). Those two are timing-fragile
  # under load, which is their own problem to fix; until then this runs on the
  # nightly lanes, where a GPU is present and scenarios are serialized.
  @id:runtime-install-records-the-real-folder @nightly
  Scenario: runtime-06 - Previewing an install through a linked runtimes folder names the real folder
    Given a machine whose runtimes folder is a link to somewhere else
    When the user previews an SDK install
    Then the planned runtime folder is inside the folder the link points at
    And the planned runtime folder is not expressed through the link

  # Linux-only: the step adopts a standard `/opt/rocm` install with a Unix python
  # path. On Windows those paths don't exist (the CLI resolves `/usr/bin/python3`
  # to a bogus `C:/usr/bin/python3` and errors on the missing path before it can
  # emit the install-type guidance), so the scenario's premise doesn't hold there.
  @id:runtime-adopt-preexisting-rejected @requires-os:linux
  Scenario: runtime-07 - Adopting a pre-existing ROCm install is rejected with guidance
    Given a machine with a standard ROCm install
    When the user tries to adopt the existing install
    Then the adoption is refused
    And the error explains which install types can be adopted

  # Both channels now resolve from one canonical aggregate index each, so the
  # provenance the preview prints is the whole of what the user can check before
  # committing to a multi-GiB install. This pins the nightly half: the source that
  # was selected, the version that came back from it, and the layout generation
  # that source was read as. `--family` is supplied so the scenario needs no GPU,
  # and `@nightly` because it resolves the real index over the network — the same
  # cost that keeps scenario runtime-06 off the unserialized mock lane.
  @id:runtime-resolve-canonical-nightly @nightly
  Scenario: runtime-08 - Previewing a nightly SDK install reports canonical provenance
    When the user dry-runs a nightly SDK install for a known family
    Then the SDK preview reports canonical nightly provenance

  # The release channel is where this went wrong in the field (rocm-cli#271). The
  # resolver read a per-family index, `repo.amd.com/rocm/whl/{family}`, which is
  # frozen at 7.13.0 and has no device payloads at all, so every release install
  # got a stale SDK and a bare `rocm[libraries,devel]` — no GPU backend in it.
  # Both halves are fixed by the same canonical model: one flat aggregate index
  # for the channel, and the device payload for the chip this host actually has.
  #
  # The obvious regression test for that history is the one that does not work.
  # Asserting the broken per-family URL is *absent* passes with the bug present:
  # the old resolver only ever printed a candidate it failed on, and the stale
  # per-family index succeeded, so the URL never reached stdout either way. These
  # Thens assert the positives instead — which source was selected, which version
  # came back from it, which device payload the plan asks for. On the old resolver
  # the first reports a per-family URL and the second finds no device payload.
  #
  # The two Thens are not one claim split in half. A preview can name the right
  # source and still ask for the wrong payload — that is exactly what the earlier
  # attempt at this fix did on Instinct hosts, resolving the aggregate correctly
  # and then requesting every device wheel ROCm publishes. Only the second Then
  # separates them.
  #
  # `@requires-gfx-target` is narrower than `@requires-gpu`: this preview only
  # needs a detected chip name and never opens the device. It therefore runs on
  # WSL hosts that can read the Windows-side target before ROCm passthrough is
  # ready, while mock hosts with no target skip it.
  @id:runtime-resolve-canonical-release @requires-gfx-target
  Scenario: runtime-09 - Previewing a release SDK install resolves the canonical aggregate for this GPU
    Given a machine with an AMD GPU
    When the user dry-runs a release SDK install for this host
    Then the SDK preview reports canonical release provenance
    And the SDK preview requests the device payload for this host's GPU

  # `rollback` can only ever undo one step, not walk a history. A unit test on
  # `render_long_help()` proves clap renders the NOTE, but not that the built
  # binary prints it to a real user (examine.feature:15-18 sets this precedent
  # for `--help` text). No runtime state needed, so this runs on the mock lane.
  @id:runtime-rollback-help-states-single-level-limit
  Scenario: runtime-10 - Stating rollback's single-level limit in --help
    When the user asks for rollback help
    Then the help states that rollback has no history

  # Installing over the active default managed runtime must not silently
  # displace it. Outside an interactive terminal (as every e2e invocation
  # is here), `install sdk` with neither consent flag must refuse rather than
  # proceed, and the refusal has to name the flag the caller should actually
  # reach for: `--approve-replacing-active-default`, not `--yes`, which would
  # additionally approve a `sudo` system-package install no script can answer.
  # GPU-gated because the precondition needs a GPU to have a runtime active.
  # The refusal is not free: the gate reports the version relation, so
  # it runs after the Python launcher is resolved and the channel index is read.
  # Both are already warm here — the `Given` installed a runtime, so the launcher
  # resolves to the saved managed Python rather than bootstrapping uv, and the
  # index read is cached — but on a cold host the launcher step can still fetch.
  # What the refusal does bail before is the SDK and torch download and any
  # change on disk.
  @id:runtime-install-sdk-overwrite-requires-yes @requires-gpu
  Scenario: runtime-11 - Reinstalling the SDK over an existing runtime without consent is refused
    Given a managed runtime is active
    When the user reinstalls the SDK without confirming
    Then the reinstall is refused
    And the error explains how to approve the replacement non-interactively

  # Companion to Scenario runtime-11: with --yes the same reinstall proceeds and the
  # runtime stays registered and active afterward. Nightly-gated in addition to
  # GPU because, unlike Scenario runtime-11, this exercises a real second SDK install.
  # The registered/active Thens hold from the Given alone, so the approval Then
  # is what actually distinguishes this from a no-op: it fails if --yes ever
  # regresses to a refusal or silently takes the fresh-install path.
  @id:runtime-install-sdk-overwrite-with-yes @requires-gpu @nightly
  Scenario: runtime-12 - Reinstalling the SDK over an existing runtime with --yes proceeds
    Given a managed runtime is active
    When the user reinstalls the SDK with --yes
    Then the install reports that --yes approved replacing the existing runtime
    And a runtime is registered
    And the runtime is set as active

  # The case a family-and-channel-scoped gate waved through. Activation is
  # global — whatever finishes installing last becomes the active default, no
  # matter which family it was built for — so installing a family this host has
  # never held displaces the active runtime exactly as a same-family reinstall
  # does, and has to ask exactly as loudly. Scenario runtime-11 cannot catch
  # this: it reinstalls the same family, so it passes under both the old
  # family-scoped gate and this one.
  #
  # No `@nightly` despite the second family: like Scenario runtime-11 this is a
  # refusal, so it bails before the multi-GiB download and costs a resolve, not
  # an install. The third Then is what separates a correct refusal from an
  # unrelated failure (a bad family name would also exit non-zero and could also
  # name the consent flags in a usage line): only the real gate names the
  # runtime it would replace.
  #
  # `@requires-os:linux` because the second family has to arrive by the tarball
  # format to reach the gate at all, and tarball installs are refused outright on
  # Windows. A wheel install picks its device payload from the GPU this host
  # reports and refuses a family that target does not belong to *before* the
  # consent gate — correctly, since that install could never have worked — so on
  # a GPU host the wheel path answers with a target error and the displacement
  # never comes up. The tarball path takes the family it is given, consults no
  # host target, and reaches the same gate. What is lost on Windows is this
  # cross-family case only: Scenario runtime-11 still covers the refusal there.
  @id:runtime-install-sdk-other-family-requires-yes @requires-gpu @requires-os:linux
  Scenario: runtime-13 - Installing a different GPU family while a runtime is active is refused without consent
    Given a managed runtime is active
    When the user installs a different GPU family without confirming
    Then the reinstall is refused
    And the error explains how to approve the replacement non-interactively
    And the error names the active default runtime it would replace

  # `--yes` approves two unrelated things: replacing the active default runtime,
  # and running `sudo` to install required system packages such as OpenMPI for
  # vLLM. ROCm CLI's own non-interactive surfaces (chat, MCP, the dashboard)
  # spawn `rocm` with null stdin, so they need the first and can never answer a
  # password prompt for the second; they pass the narrow flag instead. A reader
  # who believes the two flags are synonyms will reach for `--yes` from a script
  # and get a sudo prompt nothing can answer, so `--help` has to state the
  # difference (Scenario runtime-10 sets the precedent for pinning help text
  # that a unit test on `render_long_help()` cannot prove reaches a real user).
  # No runtime state needed, so this runs on the mock lane.
  @id:runtime-install-sdk-help-separates-consents
  Scenario: runtime-14 - Stating that the non-interactive consent flag does not approve sudo in --help
    When the user asks for SDK install help
    Then the help offers a consent flag that does not approve system-package installs

  # `rocm --yes <request>` prints the planned command twice — once under `request
  # plan`, once under `execution` — and the two deliberately disagree: the plan
  # render is shared with the no-`--yes` review path, which must never hand a
  # human a pre-approved command, so the replacement consent is injected only
  # after it. What the operator sees, though, is a consent flag appearing on the
  # command that runs and nowhere on the command they were shown, which reads as
  # something approved behind their back. The `note:` under the execution
  # `tool_call:` is the only place that difference is explained, and it is
  # command output, so a unit test on the renderer does not discharge it.
  #
  # The three Thens are one claim only if the note can be trusted on its own. It
  # cannot: a note saying "this differs from the plan above" is a lie if the two
  # lines actually agree, and a plan line that already carried the flag would
  # make the note false without changing its text. So the first two Thens pin the
  # difference the third one describes.
  #
  # The install itself must not run — on the GPU lanes this request resolves to a
  # real multi-GiB SDK pull — and these assertions are about output the CLI
  # prints *before* it dispatches. The Given makes the first step of `install
  # sdk` (finding a Python) fail, which is deterministic, offline, writes
  # nothing, and happens after the header is on stdout. That is also why the When
  # tolerates a non-zero exit. No runtime state needed, so this runs on the mock
  # lane and every other lane identically.
  @id:runtime-freeform-yes-discloses-injected-consent
  Scenario: runtime-15 - Disclosing the consent added to a natural-language install approved with --yes
    Given the CLI cannot reach a usable Python
    When the user approves a natural-language SDK install with --yes
    Then the request plan shows an install command carrying no replacement consent
    And the executed command carries the replacement consent
    And the execution section says the consent came from the user's --yes

  # Lemonade's llama.cpp backend re-pins itself to match the ROCm SDK rocm-cli
  # actually installed (Tier 1: point the pinned build at it; Tier 2: fall back
  # to the newest build if the pin is too old to have shipped a matching
  # ROCm-version asset; revert to the packaged default if neither verifies).
  # The unit tests exercise that state machine directly against injected
  # install/align steps, but nothing else asserts that `rocm engines install
  # lemonade` actually surfaces the outcome to a real user -- this is the one
  # part of that path with no other e2e coverage.
  #
  # `--reinstall` re-extracts the packaged embeddable, resetting
  # `backend_versions.json` to its pinned defaults, so this fires
  # deterministically even against a shared runtime tree where an earlier
  # scenario already left Lemonade's backend aligned (a plain install would
  # find nothing left to do and print no alignment line at all). Verified
  # against real hardware (Strix Halo, gfx1151): a fresh SDK's version does not
  # match Lemonade's packaged pin, Tier 1's install 404s (the pinned build
  # predates a matching ROCm-version asset), and Tier 2's newest build
  # succeeds -- producing exactly the line this scenario asserts.
  #
  # `@requires-engine:lemonade` because vLLM shares the SDK's own runtime
  # environment and has no llama.cpp backend to align; `@nightly` for the same
  # reason as the vLLM torch-alignment scenarios above -- a real managed SDK
  # and a real backend download, not something to repeat on every PR.
  @id:runtime-lemonade-backend-alignment-reported @requires-gpu @requires-engine:lemonade @nightly
  Scenario: runtime-16 - Reinstalling Lemonade reports whether its ROCm backend was aligned
    Given a managed runtime is active
    When the user reinstalls the lemonade engine
    Then the CLI reports that Lemonade's ROCm backend was aligned to the active SDK

  # `ROCM_CLI_DISABLE_LEMONADE_BACKEND_ALIGNMENT` is the exit for a hand-edited
  # `backend_versions.json` -- the alignment runs on every Lemonade install, so
  # without the opt-out a manual pin is silently overwritten the next time the
  # engine is installed. Mirrors the vLLM torch-alignment opt-out (scenario 4)
  # and its reasoning: a gate honoured only by the unit tests looks identical to
  # a working one from every surface a user can see, so this asserts it from the
  # CLI's own output -- the second Then does the enforcement proving (it reads
  # the packaged pin and checks for the alignment/revert log lines); the first
  # Then only proves the CLI read the variable and named it, which is a weaker
  # claim on its own. Same lane as scenario 16 and for the same reason -- a real
  # managed SDK and a real backend, on the serialized nightly GPU runners.
  @id:runtime-lemonade-backend-alignment-opt-out @requires-gpu @requires-engine:lemonade @nightly
  Scenario: runtime-17 - Opting out of the Lemonade backend alignment keeps the packaged pin
    Given a managed runtime is active
    And the user has opted out of realigning Lemonade's backend
    When the user reinstalls the lemonade engine
    Then the CLI reports that Lemonade's backend alignment was skipped by the opt-out
    And the packaged pin survives the install

  # The other half: that a runtime installed without the toolchain can actually
  # serve. vLLM compiles Triton kernels at runtime, which is the case most
  # likely to need `devel`, so it is the one worth proving end to end.
  @id:runtime-install-sdk-serves-without-toolchain @requires-gpu @requires-engine:vllm @nightly
  Scenario: runtime-18 - A runtime-only SDK install serves vLLM inference
    Given a machine with no CLI-managed runtimes
    When the user installs the SDK
    Then the runtime excludes the compiler toolchain
    When the user serves a model on GPU from the installed runtime
    And the user sends a chat completion request
    Then the response contains a model reply
    And the response identifies the correct model
