//! Guard the first-party crate dependency graph against undeclared layering
//! edges.
//!
//! `rocm-cli`'s workspace has three layering invariants that are otherwise
//! enforced and documented nowhere else in the repo:
//!
//! 1. `rocmd` must never depend on `rocm` (the reverse holds: `rocm` depends
//!    on `rocmd` for the in-process `rocm daemon` foreground path).
//! 2. `rocm-dash-core` must have no first-party dependencies — it is a pure
//!    leaf crate other subsystems build on.
//! 3. `rocm-dash-tui` must not depend on `rocm-core`.
//!
//! A literal cycle check would be a no-op: Cargo's resolver already rejects
//! dependency cycles among normal/build dependencies. The value here is
//! entirely in the **allowlist**: every first-party normal/build edge must be
//! declared in [`ALLOWLIST`], so *any* new first-party coupling — not just
//! the three named invariants — requires a conscious, reviewed addition to
//! this file. The check is bidirectional: an edge missing from
//! [`ALLOWLIST`] fails, and so does an [`ALLOWLIST`] entry with no
//! matching edge — a removed dependency must have its entry removed too,
//! or it could be silently reintroduced later without the review this
//! guard exists to force. This file is the only written record of these
//! rules; keep this comment and [`ALLOWLIST`] in sync with reality.
//!
//! Dev-dependencies are exempt: Cargo permits dev-dependency cycles (e.g.
//! `rocm-dash-daemon` dev-depends on `rocm-core` for a test-only contract
//! pin), so they are collected but never checked against the allowlist.
