Feature: TheRock "next" ROCm 10 install layout

  # ROCm 10 ships from a different source layout than the canonical multi-arch
  # release/nightly streams: a separate pip index and a separate tarball catalog
  # whose listing mixes non-release `-tests-` siblings in with the real dist
  # archive. The next layout is an explicit extension, never a default: it is
  # reachable only by pinning a ROCm version whose major is 10 or newer AND
  # naming an exact raw GFX arch, and the canonical streams keep resolving
  # exactly as they do today when neither is asked for.
  #
  # Scenarios 01-05 point source overrides at loopback fixtures through the
  # explicit trust gate. Scenario 06 proves the same overrides are inert when
  # the trust gate is absent; scenario 07 supplies the live GPU evidence.

  # The regression this pins: a "next-first" dispatch that probes the ROCm 10
  # sources before the canonical ones. An unpinned release install must never
  # look at the next layout at all, so the next fixture is served and asserted
  # untouched rather than left unconfigured.
  @id:therock-next-01-unpinned-release-stays-canonical
  Scenario: therock-next-01 - An unpinned release install stays on the canonical multi-arch source
    Given a canonical release pip index fixture and a ROCm 10 pip index fixture
    When the user previews a wheel SDK install for arch gfx1200 with no version pin
    Then the preview resolves the canonical release pip index
    And the preview reports the canonical multi-arch source layout generation
    And the preview never mentions the ROCm 10 pip index

  # `--version 10.0.0` plus a raw arch is the whole opt-in. The device payload is
  # requested as an exact `device-gfx1200` extra on rocm, torch and torchvision;
  # torchaudio carries no device extra because it publishes none.
  @id:therock-next-02-wheel-pins-raw-device-extras
  Scenario: therock-next-02 - A pinned ROCm 10 wheel install resolves the next index with raw device extras
    Given a canonical release pip index fixture and a ROCm 10 pip index fixture
    When the user previews a wheel SDK install for arch gfx1200 pinned to ROCm 10.0.0
    Then the preview resolves the ROCm 10 pip index
    And the preview reports the next source layout generation
    And the preview requests the gfx1200 device extras

  # No silent fallback: a group label carries no exact arch, and the next layout
  # cannot guess one. The install must refuse and say which flag to pass, rather
  # than dropping back to the canonical stream or to a bucket payload.
  @id:therock-next-03-wheel-group-family-refused
  Scenario: therock-next-03 - A pinned ROCm 10 wheel install refuses a group family label
    Given a canonical release pip index fixture and a ROCm 10 pip index fixture
    When the user previews a wheel SDK install for family gfx120X-all pinned to ROCm 10.0.0
    Then the install fails
    And the failure asks for an exact GPU arch and names --family gfx1200

  # Linux-only: `--format tarball` is rejected outright on Windows (native
  # tarball installs are not supported there), so this scenario's premise does
  # not hold on that platform.
  #
  # The `-tests-` sibling carries a LATER mtime than the real dist archive on the
  # live AMD index, so highest-mtime selection alone picks the wrong file.
  @id:therock-next-04-tarball-skips-tests-sibling @requires-os:linux
  Scenario: therock-next-04 - A pinned ROCm 10 tarball install skips the tests sibling
    Given a canonical release tarball fixture and a ROCm 10 tarball fixture with a tests sibling
    When the user previews a tarball SDK install for arch gfx1200 pinned to ROCm 10.0.0
    Then the preview resolves the ROCm 10 tarball catalog
    And the preview reports the next source layout generation
    And the preview selects the real tarball artifact
    And the preview does not select the tests artifact

  # Same refusal on the tarball path, which is a separate dispatch: pinning a
  # version was rejected outright for tarball installs before ROCm 10, so the
  # newly reachable path needs its own proof that it still demands a raw arch.
  @id:therock-next-05-tarball-group-family-refused @requires-os:linux
  Scenario: therock-next-05 - A pinned ROCm 10 tarball install refuses a group family label
    Given a canonical release tarball fixture and a ROCm 10 tarball fixture with a tests sibling
    When the user previews a tarball SDK install for family gfx120X-all pinned to ROCm 10.0.0
    Then the install fails
    And the failure asks for an exact GPU arch and names --family gfx1200

  # Artifact base overrides are a trust boundary. Merely naming an override
  # must not redirect the CLI; the separate opt-in is required. This scenario
  # reaches the live default index (not a fixture, since proving the *default*
  # is what resolves requires the real default), so it runs on the scheduled
  # network lane rather than the hermetic ones above. The unit test
  # `env_override_is_ignored_end_to_end_without_the_opt_in` in
  # `apps/rocm/src/therock.rs` covers the same trust boundary on the blocking
  # lane, without depending on the live network.
  @id:therock-next-06-base-override-requires-opt-in @nightly
  Scenario: therock-next-06 - A ROCm 10 source override is ignored without explicit trust
    Given an untrusted ROCm 10 pip base override
    When the user previews a wheel SDK install for arch gfx1200 pinned to the latest published ROCm 10 version
    Then the preview resolves the default ROCm 10 pip index
    And the preview never mentions the untrusted ROCm 10 pip index

  # Not hermetic like the scenarios above: this one installs for real, against
  # the live stable.repo.amd.com, on a self-hosted GPU runner, with no
  # --family override at all. `resolve_family` already falls back to
  # `detect_host_gfx_target()` when nothing overrides it, so a pinned ROCm 10
  # install should resolve the runner's real GPU into the exact arch the next
  # layout needs without the user ever typing a raw GFX code. The fixture
  # scenarios above can't prove this: their fixtures serve a fixed gfx1200
  # regardless of what GPU the runner actually has. Deliberately not tagged
  # `@requires-engine:vllm`: that tag would skip this scenario's arch-detection
  # assertions wherever vLLM can't start (e.g. a lemonade-only Strix host),
  # narrowing coverage this scenario exists to provide. See therock-next-09 for
  # the vLLM-specific route, which pays for its own runtime instead.
  @id:therock-next-07-live-install-auto-detects-arch @requires-gpu @nightly
  Scenario: therock-next-07 - Installing the SDK from the live ROCm 10 preview source auto-detects the exact arch
    Given a machine with no CLI-managed runtimes
    When the user installs the SDK from the ROCm 10 preview source with no family override
    Then the install used the ROCm 10 preview source
    And the install requested the device extras for this host's detected GPU
    And a runtime is registered
    And the runtime is set as active
    And the runtime includes an inference engine
    And the ROCm 10 runtime passes SDK and Torch GPU probes

  # The regression this pins is distinct from therock-next-02's: that scenario
  # proves a *fresh* install resolves an exact arch when the user supplies one.
  # This one proves *updating* an already-installed next-layout runtime works
  # when all the CLI has on hand is the manifest's group family (`gfx120X-all`)
  # — exactly what every installed ROCm 10 runtime's manifest carries, since
  # `--family` is only ever typed once. A fix that recovers the exact arch for
  # planning (deciding a newer version exists) but not for applying (actually
  # resolving and installing it) leaves this scenario red.
  @id:therock-next-08-update-apply-recovers-exact-arch-from-grouped-family
  Scenario: therock-next-08 - Updating a ROCm 10 wheel runtime resolves past its grouped family
    Given a canonical release pip index fixture and a ROCm 10 pip index fixture
    And a registered ROCm 10 wheel runtime with a grouped family
    When the user previews applying the pending update to that runtime
    # With the toolchain because that runtime's recorded specs have it: an
    # update must reinstall what was installed, not the current default.
    Then the preview requests the gfx1200 device extras with the toolchain

  # Proves the vLLM ROCm 10.x wheel discovery route rather than the fixed pin
  # table other SDK versions use: AMD publishes vllm, flash-attn, and
  # amd-aiter under rotating dev-tag filenames for ROCm 10.x, so the adapter
  # resolves each package's current wheel from AMD's live index with
  # `uv pip install --dry-run --reinstall` before installing pinned to what
  # that reported. No fixture can serve a rotating dev-tag filename and stay
  # meaningful, so this is the only place that mechanism runs against the
  # real index at all. Provisions its own ROCm 10 runtime rather than reusing
  # therock-next-07's, so that scenario's arch-detection coverage still runs
  # on hosts that can't start vLLM.
  @id:therock-next-09-live-install-reports-vllm-rocm10x-discovery-pins @requires-gpu @requires-engine:vllm @nightly
  Scenario: therock-next-09 - Installing vLLM against a live ROCm 10 preview runtime reports the discovery pins
    Given a machine with no CLI-managed runtimes
    When the user installs the SDK from the ROCm 10 preview source with no family override
    Then a runtime is registered
    And the runtime is set as active
    And the runtime includes an inference engine
    When the user reinstalls vllm
    Then the install reports the vLLM ROCm 10.x discovery pins

  # The opt-in half of therock-next-02. Both polarities run here, on the mock
  # lane, because this is the only place the flag's effect on the real install
  # plan is observable without a GPU and a multi-GiB download.
  #
  # Deliberately not `@nightly`. Gating it would make the asymmetry that
  # therock-next-02 alone cannot cover: hardcoding `include_devel = true` inside
  # `install_wheel_runtime` fails therock-next-02, but hardcoding it to FALSE —
  # making `--devel` a silent no-op on every real install — would pass every
  # blocking check with this scenario off the lane. The unit tests cannot close
  # that gap: they pass the flag literally, so they pin the helpers, not what
  # `install_wheel_runtime` passes them.
  #
  # This scenario was briefly moved to the nightly lane because the extra
  # index-resolving work tipped `dash-gen-tps-held-after-scrape-failure` and
  # `dash-gen-tps-expiry-boundary` past the validity window they assert on.
  # Those two now hold their observation clock instead of racing the host
  # (rocm-cli#412), which is the layer that was actually broken, so the reason
  # to displace this coverage is gone.
  #
  # The `@id:` still reads `-09-`: this scenario was written as therock-next-09
  # and the display index moved when main landed one ahead of it. The id is the
  # stable identifier and is deliberately not renumbered with the index.
  @id:therock-next-09-wheel-devel-adds-the-toolchain
  Scenario: therock-next-10 - A pinned ROCm 10 wheel install adds the toolchain when asked
    Given a canonical release pip index fixture and a ROCm 10 pip index fixture
    When the user previews a wheel SDK install for arch gfx1200 pinned to ROCm 10.0.0 with the toolchain
    Then the preview resolves the ROCm 10 pip index
    And the preview requests the gfx1200 device extras with the toolchain
