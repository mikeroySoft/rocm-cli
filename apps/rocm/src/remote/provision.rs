//! Putting the ROCm CLI on a machine that does not have it.
//!
//! The obvious approach — copy the binary we are running — is wrong, and
//! quietly so. It only works when both machines share an OS and CPU
//! architecture, and when they do not the copy still lands, still runs as a
//! file, and fails with something unhelpful at the first invocation.
//!
//! So provisioning never copies this machine's binary. It asks the remote to
//! fetch its own build, using the project's own installer, which already knows
//! how to detect a platform and verify what it downloads — and does all of that
//! *on the remote*, for the remote. Only if the remote cannot reach the release
//! host does this machine fetch on its behalf, and then it fetches an artifact
//! built for the remote's platform, not for ours.
//!
//! Which of those two applies is not guessed in advance. "Does this machine
//! have internet" has no reliable signal from the outside, so the remote install
//! is simply attempted, and only *that command* failing selects the fallback.
