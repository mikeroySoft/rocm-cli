Feature: Release install lifecycle

  # The full release lifecycle — packaging, signature-verified install, tamper
  # rejection, reinstall, PATH handling, and uninstall — expressed as black-box
  # scenarios that drive `xtask package`, the real root installer
  # (install.sh / install.ps1), and the installed binaries. These replace the
  # former scripts/acceptance-install-upgrade-tui-uninstall.{sh,ps1}.
  #
  # Every scenario is tagged @lifecycle and is SKIPPED by default so the fast
  # `cargo xtask e2e` suite stays fast. Run the current host's set explicitly:
  #   E2E_INCLUDE_LIFECYCLE=1 E2E_ONLY_LIFECYCLE=1 cargo xtask e2e
  # They are also expensive and OS-mutating, so heavy CI runs them per platform.
  #
  # Scenarios are independent: each packages its own bundle, generates its own
  # signing key, and installs into its own directory rooted in the scenario's
  # temp dir, so ordering never affects the outcome. Cargo's release build cache
  # is shared naturally.
