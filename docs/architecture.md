# Architecture

This is the living module map for rocm-cli. It's a contributor-facing reference to where things live and why, updated in the same PR as the code it documents. It also tracks the files still pending modularization (see EAI-7768) so contributors know what's coming — but it is not a design-history document: entries describe current structure, not the decisions or debates that produced it.

> Before relying on any entry below, verify current file and function boundaries directly (e.g. `grep`) rather than trusting this doc's wording. Module boundaries shift as the codebase grows, and a stale-but-plausible-looking note is worse than an explicit prompt to check. `cargo xtask check-architecture-doc` fails CI if a path citation isn't found where it's cited, naming the expected location per citation (exactly where depends on its shape — see `citation_exists`'s doc comment in `xtask/src/architecture_doc.rs` for the full rule) — but it doesn't check that the surrounding prose (e.g. which extraction pattern a module follows) is still accurate; the caution above still applies to everything but that existence check.

## Module organization convention

New subcommands and subsystems default to their own file from day one — they should not grow inside `main.rs`/`lib.rs` waiting for a future extraction pass. Two extraction patterns already exist in the codebase; use whichever fits:

- **Full domain extraction** — a subsystem's domain implementation moves into its own file that owns its own types (structs/enums), not just relocated functions; that ownership is what distinguishes this pattern from mechanical relocation below — every `apps/rocm` module is a private `mod x;` accessed via qualified paths (e.g. `comfyui::render_status(...)`) regardless of pattern, so module privacy alone doesn't tell the two apart. Where a subsystem has a dedicated clap subcommand, its command enum and dispatch function usually stay in `main.rs` (e.g. `ComfyuiCommand`/`comfyui()`, `RuntimesCommand`/`runtimes()`) — but not every domain-extracted module has one (`providers.rs` has no dedicated command enum; it's invoked from the existing chat/config command flows). In library crates (`crates/rocm-core`) the module is `pub mod x;` plus a `pub use x::{...};` re-export, since it's part of the crate's public API. This is the default for new subsystems. Examples: `apps/rocm/src/therock.rs` (`RuntimesCommand`), `comfyui.rs` (`ComfyuiCommand`), `providers.rs` (no dedicated command enum); `crates/rocm-core`'s `diagnose.rs`/`examine.rs`.
- **Mechanical relocation** — a `pub(crate) fn` moves out verbatim, with shared types/config staying at the crate root and reached via `crate::`. Used for dispatch-adjacent clusters where a minimal, easy-to-review diff matters more than full extraction. Examples: `apps/rocm/src/automations.rs`, `uninstall.rs`.

There is no file-line-count CI gate enforcing this — `too_many_lines = "allow"` in the workspace `Cargo.toml` is a deliberate, function-level choice, not an oversight. This convention is the guardrail instead.

## Module map

Scoped to the crates that make up the shipped CLI/daemon/dashboard/engine surface, plus `crates/e2e-report` (a shared exception: it's HTML/markdown reporting consumed only by `xtask` and `tests/e2e-cucumber`, but it's still one of the modularization effort's target files, so it's mapped below). Dev-tooling and test-harness workspace members (`xtask`, `tests/e2e-cucumber` themselves) are otherwise out of scope — they're not part of the modularization effort's inventory.

### `apps/rocm` — main CLI binary

Subsystem modules already following full domain extraction (each owns its own types): `therock.rs`, `comfyui.rs`, `providers.rs`, `chat_host_facts.rs`, `dash.rs`, `dash_seam.rs`, `provider_keys.rs`, `serve_summary.rs`, `storage.rs`. Mechanically relocated dispatch-adjacent handlers (no owned types, shared config stays at the crate root): `automations.rs`, `uninstall.rs`, `endpoint_keys.rs`, `logging.rs`. `bootstrap.rs` is a further-extracted variant of full domain extraction: it owns its clap command enum (`BootstrapCommand`) and dispatch function too, rather than leaving them in `main.rs`. Shared CLI-output components: `cli_progress.rs` (`Spinner`, `AnimatedSpinner`), `cli_report.rs` (`ActionReport`).

`main.rs` itself is **not yet modularized** — see EAI-7768, split planned across several PRs, one cluster at a time.

### `apps/rocmd` — background daemon

`lib.rs` modularization is in progress (ROCMAI-83, Phase 5 of EAI-7768's sequencing). Extracted so far: `persistence.rs` (`record_event`/`load_managed_services`, the automation-event/audit-log and managed-service-registry I/O shared across the daemon's sandbox, MCP, service-lifecycle, and watcher code). Still pending: a shared-helpers module for code used across ≥2 of those remaining clusters (GPU/amd-smi snapshotting, the bridge-snapshot diagnostic, small arg/healthcheck utilities), plus the CLI, sandbox, MCP, service-lifecycle, webhook, and watcher clusters themselves — each landing as its own PR.

### `crates/rocm-core` — core library

Already-extracted subsystem modules include `diagnose.rs`, `examine.rs`, `model_readiness.rs` (the `rocm diagnose --model`/`rocm model --verbose` fit assessment: curated-recipe lookup against a host's measured GPU/RAM, shared between the two commands so they cannot disagree about whether a model fits), and several siblings following the same pattern. `lib.rs` itself is **not yet modularized** — see EAI-7768, planned last in the modularization effort: highest fan-in (every app and engine crate depends on it), but lowest novelty since the existing sibling modules already prove the pattern works.

### `crates/rocm-dash-core`, `rocm-dash-collectors`, `rocm-dash-daemon`, `rocm-dash-tui` — dashboard/telemetry

`rocm-dash-tui`'s `agent/mod.rs`/`agent/snapshot.rs`/`agent/tools.rs`/`agent/clients.rs` and `app/mod.rs`/`app/types.rs`/`app/event_loop.rs`/`app/scrollbar.rs`/`app/actions.rs`/`app/chat.rs`/`app/slash.rs`/`app/summary.rs` are every file this phase's dashboard-TUI split touches. The old agent.rs was split into `agent/mod.rs` (the `AgentClient` seam, `AgentError`, `StateSnapshot`, `InferenceParams`, `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`), `agent/snapshot.rs` (pure JSON telemetry helpers with no `rig` dependency), `agent/tools.rs` (the `rig::tool::Tool` "Skill" wrappers and ROCm read/mutating tool dispatch), and `agent/clients.rs` (the `RigAgentClient`/`ChatGptAgentClient`/`AnthropicAgentClient`/`MockAgentClient` backends) — a mechanical relocation, since the shared seam types stay in `agent/mod.rs` and are reached from the split-out files via `super::`. `app/mod.rs` is modularized (ROCMAI-84, Phase 4 of EAI-7768's sequencing) into an app/ directory following full domain extraction: `app/types.rs` (shared type/enum defs — `Focus`, `ResolvedArgs`, connection/tab/chat/replay state, `Modal`, `UpdateStatus`, and the slash/plan/approval payload types; no `AppState` access), `app/event_loop.rs` (terminal lifecycle, signal handling, and the tick loop — `run`, `event_loop`, the termination-signal watcher, and the startup-focus / Updates-tile tick helpers), `app/scrollbar.rs` (mouse/scroll hit-testing: resolving a raw `MouseEvent` against recorded scrollbar tracks, the tab bar, and footer-legend chips into a `KeyAction`), `app/actions.rs` (`KeyAction` dispatch: translating a key press or resolved mouse hit into a `KeyAction` and applying it to reducer state). `app/mod.rs` keeps only `AppState`, its `apply_event`/`apply_action`-adjacent reducer impl, and the handful of items that stay with it (`ProviderSwitch`, `HISTORY_CAP`, `BENCH_CAP`) — the modularization effort's "reducer's reason to exist." `crate::app::*` paths for the public surface moved out are unchanged via re-exports from `app/mod.rs` (see the re-export block's comment for what counts as "public surface"). `app/chat.rs`, `app/slash.rs`, and `app/summary.rs` were previously extracted from `app/mod.rs` following the same mechanical-relocation convention this phase's agent.rs split mirrors. `crates/rocm-dash-tui/src/ui/approval.rs` is the shared component for approval-state prompts — reuse it rather than hand-rolling new approval UI.

### `crates/rocm-engine-protocol` — engine IPC protocol

A contract surface: verify all impacted engines after any protocol change here (see `AGENTS.md`).

### `crates/rocm-deps`

Pinned versions of the third-party runtimes rocm-cli manages (from workspace-root `runtime-deps.toml`, turned into constants by `build.rs`). Small and already single-purpose; not part of the modularization effort's target list.

### `crates/e2e-report`

Modularized (EAI-8032, Phase 1 of EAI-7768's sequencing): `parse.rs` (cucumber `report.json` data model, parsing, and `@expected-failure` xfail evaluation), `single_report.rs` (single-platform HTML report generation), `consolidated.rs` (the `PlatformReport`/manifest/expectation model, the reconciled scenario × platform `Grid`, and the multi-platform HTML/markdown generation built on top — the largest module), `components.rs` (shared maud HTML fragment rendering, plus the CSS and timestamp helpers both generators use, depending only on `parse.rs` types to keep the module graph acyclic). The four modules are private `mod` declarations — `lib.rs` re-exports only the selected public API surface (`XfailReport`, `evaluate_xfail`, `scenario_results_by_id`, `generate`, `RunMeta`, `generate_consolidated`, `consolidated_summary_markdown`) via `pub use`, so consumers reach it through the crate root rather than through module-qualified paths like `e2e_report::parse::...`. This is a deliberate encapsulation choice tighter than the full-domain-extraction convention's `pub mod x;` + `pub use x::{...};` default described above — nothing outside this crate needs the module paths themselves, only the re-exported items.

### `engines/lemonade`, `engines/vllm` — inference engine adapters

`engines/vllm`'s `runtime.rs`/`install.rs`/`process.rs`/`state.rs` follow full domain extraction: `runtime.rs` handles TheRock/managed-runtime resolution, `install.rs` handles ROCm/vLLM build-variant discovery, install execution, and runtime-repair assessment, `process.rs` handles spawn/env/path setup and readiness polling, and `state.rs` handles service state file I/O. `lib.rs` keeps only CLI/envelope dispatch and the few items shared across those modules. `engines/lemonade`'s `install.rs`/`backend_alignment.rs`/`process.rs`/`runtime_dir.rs`/`direct_llama.rs`/`state.rs` follow the same pattern across six modules: `install.rs` handles embeddable-runtime archive download/verify/extract, cache locking, and manifest persistence, `backend_alignment.rs` handles ROCm-SDK-to-llama.cpp-backend Tier 1/Tier 2/revert alignment and backend discovery/install/selection, `process.rs` handles `lemond`/llama-server spawn, env/path setup, and readiness/health polling, `runtime_dir.rs` handles `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` tier1/2/3 hardening for the spawned child, `direct_llama.rs` handles Hugging Face checkpoint/GGUF resolution and the direct-llama-server serve path, and `state.rs` handles service state file I/O, device-policy/GPU-selection parsing, and port/endpoint helpers. `lib.rs` keeps only CLI/envelope dispatch and the service-lifecycle orchestration that calls across those modules.
