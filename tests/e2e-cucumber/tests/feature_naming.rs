//! Drift guard for the `.feature` files' scenario naming and ids.
//!
//! The report groups its expectation grid by feature and orders rows by the
//! `<feature-key>-<NN>` index in each scenario's name, so that convention is
//! load-bearing, not cosmetic. It had already drifted once — indexes restarting
//! at 1 in every file, `examine` numbered 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, a stray `6b` in
//! `model_serving`, and no indexes at all in `install_lifecycle`.
//!
//! This runs in the ordinary `cargo test` set (unlike the `e2e` target, which
//! needs a real `rocm` binary), so a mis-numbered scenario is caught without a
//! full suite run.
