//! Steps for `rocm storage report` — the command whose job is to tell a user
//! what ROCm CLI has put on their disk.
//!
//! Black-box throughout: the scenario plants a local server record the same way
//! `rocm serve --managed` would, then reads the real binary's rendered report.
//! No GPU and no network, so this runs on the mock lane every PR.
