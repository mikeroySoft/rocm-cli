        Local AI on AMD GPUs — one binary, zero setup
```

ROCm CLI is a command-line tool for setting up and running local AI on AMD GPUs, with a
full-screen TUI dashboard for GPU telemetry, model serving, and chat.

It ships as a single prebuilt binary for Linux and Windows (x86_64), needs no
Python, Rust, or existing ROCm install, and includes inference engine adapters
for Lemonade and vLLM.

<!-- platform-support-table-start -->
| Platform | Prebuilt binary | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linux (x86_64) | Yes | Ubuntu 24.04 or newer; full support, including the live dashboard and both inference engines |
| Windows (x86_64) | Yes | CLI and Lemonade serving; no live dashboard or vLLM |
| WSL2 (x86_64) | Yes (Linux binary) | Ubuntu 24.04 or newer; full support, including the live dashboard; see [docs/wsl.md](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/blob/main/docs/wsl.md) for setup |
| macOS | No | No official installer, release, CI, or QA coverage |
<!-- platform-support-table-end -->

Live dashboard telemetry requires Linux or WSL2 (see
[Interactive interfaces](#interactive-interfaces)). vLLM serving is Linux or WSL2
only (see [docs/vllm.md](docs/vllm.md)).

The minimum supported Linux release, native or under WSL2, is Ubuntu 24.04. On
other distributions the equivalent requirement is glibc 2.38 with
`GLIBCXX_3.4.32`: that is what the Lemonade engine is linked against, and every
published build of it needs those versions, so there is no older release to fall
back to. Ubuntu 22.04 ships glibc 2.35 and cannot run it; Ubuntu 24.04 provides
glibc 2.39 and `GLIBCXX_3.4.33`.

## Installation

The installer downloads a prebuilt bundle, verifies its SHA-256 checksum,
installs the `rocm` and `rocmd` binaries into `~/.local/bin`, and adds that
directory to your shell `PATH`. Rerun it any time to upgrade.

### Linux and WSL (x86_64)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

This tracks the default `release` channel. For nightly builds, pass the
`nightly` channel instead:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/main/install.sh | sh -s -- nightly
```

### Windows (x86_64, PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

This tracks the default `release` channel. For nightly builds, set
`ROCM_CLI_CHANNEL` to `nightly` first:

```powershell
$env:ROCM_CLI_CHANNEL = "nightly"
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Build from source

Building requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/); the pinned toolchain in
`rust-toolchain.toml` (currently 1.96.0) installs automatically via `rustup`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-cli
cd rocm-cli
cargo build --release
```

This produces the two binaries under `target/release/`:

- `rocm` — the CLI and interactive interfaces
- `rocmd` — the background telemetry daemon used by the dashboard

Run without installing:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin rocm -- examine
```

Or copy the release binaries onto your `PATH`:

```bash
install -m 0755 target/release/rocm target/release/rocmd ~/.local/bin/
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full development setup, test
commands, and commit-signing requirements.

## First run

Launch ROCm CLI with no arguments:

```
rocm
```

With no arguments on an interactive terminal, `rocm` opens the **launcher** — a
small front-door menu that gets you to the common tasks:

- **Set up this system** — install or update ROCm
- **Serve a model** — run a model on your GPU
- **Diagnose & fix** — check GPU, driver, and ROCm
- **Chat** — talk to a local or API-backed model
- **Open full dashboard →** — escalate into the live dashboard (`rocm dash`)

Pick a row with the arrow keys and `Enter`; press `q` to quit. On a
non-interactive terminal (or piped output), `rocm` prints a one-shot status
summary instead of opening the launcher.

## Interactive interfaces

`rocm` ships two terminal UIs built on [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/):

### The launcher (`rocm`)

The lightweight hub described above. It runs the guided **Set up**, **Serve**,
**Diagnose**, and **Chat** flows in place, and hands off to the full dashboard
when you need live instruments. This is the default surface for everyday use;
the legacy full-screen setup assistant has been retired.

### The dashboard (`rocm dash`)

The full-screen telemetry dashboard — every instrument and action on one screen.
It auto-starts an embedded `rocmd` daemon when none is running, then presents
five tabs (switch with `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` or number keys `1`–`5`):

| Tab | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Home** | At-a-glance status: GPU, active runtime, running servers |
| **ROCm** | Guided ROCm and runtime actions with inline details |
| **Serving** | Start, inspect, and manage model servers |
| **Observe** | Live GPU utilization, instances, and benchmark telemetry |
| **Chat** | Assistant chat backed by a local server or configured provider |

Live mode reads telemetry over a Unix domain socket, so it requires Linux or
WSL. Use `rocm dash --demo` for a synthetic session that runs anywhere without a
GPU or daemon.

## Configure ROCm and serve a model

Before serving a model, ensure a managed ROCm runtime is configured:

```
rocm install sdk
```

This downloads TheRock ROCm wheels and a matching PyTorch stack into a managed
environment. On machines with an existing ROCm install, `rocm examine` will
show it as `legacy_rocm_status: detected_unmanaged` — running `rocm install sdk`
creates a separate managed runtime alongside it.

Then serve a model:

```
rocm serve qwen
```

`qwen` is a built-in alias for a small assistant model that serves out of the
box. You can also serve any compatible Hugging Face model directly — see
[Model serving](#model-serving) for the GGUF-vs-safetensors rule, since which
form works depends on the engine your GPU selects.

## Commands

### Examine

```
rocm examine [--json] [--framework auto|pytorch|llama-cpp|skip]
```

Checks this computer's GPU, ROCm install, engines, and managed setup
folders — the command to run first to see whether a system is ready, and
what `rocm install sdk` and `rocm serve` will see. `--json` emits a
machine-readable report for diagnosis tooling instead of the human-readable
summary. `--framework` controls which ML framework the `--json` report probes
for its ROCm build and compiled GPU architectures: `auto` (the default) tries
PyTorch, then falls back to llama.cpp; `pytorch` or `llama-cpp` probe only
that framework; `skip` runs no framework probe at all, which is fastest and
still enough to answer GPU and driver questions. `--framework` only affects
the JSON report, not the human-readable one.

### ROCm installation

```
rocm install sdk    [--channel release|nightly] [--format wheel|tarball]
                    [--version x.y.z | --build-date YYYY-MM-DD]
                    [--family gfx110X-all] [--prefix PATH] [--dry-run]

rocm install driver [--dkms] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--reconcile]

rocm update         [--apply] [--runtime KEY] [--activate] [--dry-run]
```

`install sdk` downloads TheRock ROCm wheels into a Python environment managed
by rocm-cli. `install driver` installs the AMD kernel driver on Linux (DKMS or
native package). `update` checks for a newer ROCm package; pass `--apply` to
install it.

### Runtime management

Manage multiple side-by-side ROCm installs:

```
rocm runtimes list
rocm runtimes activate <runtime-key>
rocm runtimes rollback
rocm runtimes uninstall <runtime-key>
rocm runtimes import <manifest-file> [--replace]
rocm runtimes adopt --python <path> [--root <path>] [--runtime-id ID]
                    [--runtime-key KEY] [--channel LABEL] [--replace]
```

`adopt` registers an existing TheRock-based Python environment as a managed
runtime. It does not work with standard ROCm package installs (for example,
`/opt/rocm`); use `rocm install sdk` instead.

### Disk space

Each ROCm install keeps its own multi-gigabyte folder, so installing or
updating a few times adds up. `rocm storage` shows where the space went and
frees the parts that are safe to remove:

```
rocm storage [report] [--json]
rocm storage remove-old-installs [--keep N] [--dry-run] [--yes]
rocm storage remove-downloads [--dry-run] [--yes]
```

`remove-old-installs` keeps the two most recent installs for each channel,
format, and GPU family, and never touches the install in use, the rollback
target, or a folder rocm-cli did not create. "Most recent" means most recently
installed rather than highest version, so after a deliberate downgrade the
older version counts as the newer install. Because the count applies per
channel, format, and GPU family, a machine that has tried several channels
keeps `--keep` installs for each of them. Anything it declines to remove is
listed with the reason, and `--dry-run` shows the whole plan without changing
anything. `remove-downloads` clears cached archives that rocm-cli can download
again; a cache folder that is a link to somewhere else is left alone rather
than followed. The report also lists the
`uv` package cache and downloaded models; those are shared with other tools
and are never removed by rocm-cli.

### Inference engines

```
rocm engines list
rocm engines install <engine> [--runtime-id KEY] [--python-version X.Y] [--reinstall]
rocm engines shell <engine>   [--runtime-id KEY | --env-id ID] [--shell PATH]
```

Supported engines: `lemonade`, `vllm`.

### Model serving

Start a local OpenAI-compatible model server:

```
rocm serve <model> [--engine lemonade|vllm]
                   [--device gpu_required|gpu_preferred]
                   [--gpu auto|<index>]
                   [--runtime-id KEY | --env-id ID]
                   [--host HOST] [--port PORT]
                   [--verbose] [--foreground | --managed]
                   [--no-smoke-test]
                   [--allow-public-bind]
                   [--temperature TEMP] [--top-p PROB] [--max-tokens N]
```

`--temperature` (>= 0.0), `--top-p` (0.0-1.0), and `--max-tokens` (> 0) set
server-wide sampling defaults for the launched engine. They apply only to
`vllm` and `lemonade`; other engines reject them. For vLLM they are folded
into a single `--override-generation-config` JSON object (`--max-tokens` maps
to vLLM's `max_new_tokens`); for Lemonade they pass straight through as
llama.cpp's `--temperature`, `--top-p`, and `--n-predict` flags. Each control
is optional and independent — omit any of them to keep the engine's own
default.

`rocm serve` only reuses an already-running service for the same engine and
model if its sampling controls (and other recipe settings) match the ones
requested this time; otherwise it errors out instead of silently serving with
different settings. If you previously started a service with `--temperature`
(or another sampling flag) and now run `rocm serve` for the same model without
flags — or with different ones — stop the existing service first (`rocm
services stop`) or match the original flags.

By default the server runs in the background under rocm-cli's supervision and
prints a deployment summary — a progress indicator while it starts, then a table
with the status, the full inference endpoint, the API-qualified model name, and a
quick smoke test (time to first token and approximate tokens/sec). Control
returns to your shell with the server still running; manage it later with `rocm
services` (below).

`--verbose` (or `--foreground`) instead attaches to the server in the current
terminal and streams every engine log line — use it to debug a startup problem.
The server still runs as a managed background process, so while streaming you can
press **Ctrl-D to detach** — the log stream stops, your shell comes back, and the
server keeps running (manage it afterward with `rocm services`). Press **Ctrl-C**
to stop the server instead. `--managed` is the explicit form of the default
background behavior. `--no-smoke-test` skips the post-startup inference probe.

Which model form to pass depends on the engine your GPU selects. The Lemonade
engine (Ryzen AI or Radeon) serves llama.cpp **GGUF** models — pass a GGUF repo
with an explicit quantization variant, for example,
`rocm serve unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF:Q4_0`. The vLLM engine (Instinct) serves
**safetensors** repos, such as `rocm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`. A
safetensors-only id has no GGUF build, so serving it through Lemonade fails
rather than silently substituting a different model.

Some models (such as Llama) are gated and require HuggingFace authentication.
Log in with `huggingface-cli login` or set `HF_TOKEN` in your environment
before serving gated models.

`--gpu` selects which AMD GPU the server runs on. `auto` (the default) probes
per-GPU VRAM with `amd-smi` and picks the lowest-numbered GPU that is idle and
not already used by another rocm-cli server (managed or foreground), falling
back to the GPU with the most free memory. Pass a single index (`--gpu 1`) to
pin a specific device. The
selected GPU is exposed to the engine via `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. Serving one
model across multiple GPUs is not supported. Because selection uses the
`amd-smi` ordinal but is applied via `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, rocm-cli warns when
`ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is set, since the two orderings can diverge.

Manage background servers started with `--managed`:

```
rocm services list [--all]
rocm services logs <service-id>
rocm services stop <service-id> [--yes]
rocm services restart <service-id> [--yes]
```

### Dashboard

```
rocm dash [--demo] [--replay <file>]
```

Full-screen TUI with Home, ROCm, Serving, Observe, and Chat tabs — GPU
utilization graphs, active serving instances, benchmark results, guided actions,
and a chat tab backed by any configured provider. See
[Interactive interfaces](#interactive-interfaces) for the tab breakdown.

- `--demo` runs a deterministic synthetic session with no GPU or daemon needed,
  works on all platforms.
- `--replay <file>` replays a recorded NDJSON session.
- Live mode requires Unix domain sockets (Linux and WSL only).

### Chat

```
rocm chat [--provider anthropic|openai|...] [--model NAME] [--prompt TEXT] [--tools]
          [--temperature TEMP] [--top-p PROB] [--max-tokens N]
```

Chat with an AI provider from the terminal. Reads from stdin when `--prompt` is
omitted. `--temperature`, `--top-p`, and `--max-tokens` are optional sampling
controls forwarded to the request; each is independent, so omit any of them to
use the provider's default.

### Agent harnesses

Configure supported agent CLIs to use a local ROCm model server:

```
rocm agents
rocm agents <agent>
rocm agents <agent> --setup --dry-run [--model MODEL] [--base-url URL]
                    [--agent-version VERSION]
rocm agents <agent> --setup --yes [--model MODEL] [--base-url URL]
                    [--agent-version VERSION] [--no-check]
rocm agents <agent> --test [--agent-version VERSION]
```

Supported harness names are `claude`, `hermes`, `openclaw`, `codex`,
`opencode`, `qwen-code`, `aider`, and `continue`; `rocm agents` lists them
with installation and configuration status. `rocm agents <agent>` inspects
one harness without changing it, including its detected executable, version,
configuration path, endpoint, and model. Use `--agent-version` to select a
supported configuration schema explicitly, including when preparing setup
before the harness is installed.

Setup automatically uses the unique ready loopback service managed by
rocm-cli. `--model` selects a matching service when several are ready. If no
managed service matches, setup falls back to
`http://127.0.0.1:11435/v1`; supply `--model` for an offline setup plan, or
start a server with `rocm serve <model>`. An explicit `--base-url` must be a
loopback HTTP URL; if `--model` is omitted, the endpoint must advertise one
unambiguous model.

`--dry-run` prints the target and file changes without writing them. A normal
setup prompts before writing; `--yes` supplies that approval for scripts and
other non-interactive use. After writing, setup probes the harness's native
API route with the exact model and restores the previous configuration if the
check fails. `--no-check` deliberately keeps the configuration without making
that protocol request.

`--test` runs the installed harness against a nonce probe in an isolated
temporary workspace using harness-specific safe arguments. It verifies the
probe remains intact and the nonce appears in the harness's final output,
without exposing the caller's repository. Harnesses may create ordinary
cache or session files inside that temporary workspace.

### ComfyUI

Install and manage ComfyUI for image generation (alias: `rocm comfy`):

```
rocm comfyui install    [--runtime-id KEY] [--reinstall] [--dry-run]
rocm comfyui start      [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--no-open-browser]
rocm comfyui stop
rocm comfyui status
rocm comfyui logs       [--lines N]
rocm comfyui models-path
```

### Automations

```
rocm automations list
rocm automations enable <watcher-id>  [--mode observe|propose|contained]
rocm automations disable <watcher-id>
```

Optional background checks that can propose or apply changes automatically.

### Configuration

Show or change rocm-cli's saved settings — the default engine and runtime,
which runtime each engine prefers, local GPU telemetry opt-in, and the
provider used for chat, automations, and ambiguous natural-language plans
(including enabling providers and storing their API keys).

```
rocm config show
rocm config set-default-engine <engine>
rocm config clear-default-engine
rocm config set-default-runtime <runtime-id>
rocm config clear-default-runtime
rocm config set-engine <engine> [--runtime-id KEY | --env-id ID | --clear]
rocm config set-telemetry local|off
rocm config set-planner-provider <provider>
rocm config clear-planner-provider
rocm config enable-provider <provider>
rocm config disable-provider <provider>
rocm config set-provider-key <provider>
rocm config clear-provider-key <provider>
```

### Logs and cleanup

```
rocm logs [--service <service-id>] [--search TERM ...]

rocm uninstall [--yes] [--dry-run]
               [--keep-binaries] [--keep-config] [--keep-data] [--keep-cache]
```

### Shell completions

`rocm completions <shell>` prints a completion script for the given shell to
stdout. Supported shells are `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `elvish`, and `powershell`.

```
rocm completions <bash|zsh|fish|elvish|powershell>
```

Install the script for your shell:

```
# bash (per-user, no sudo; add this line to ~/.bashrc to persist)
source <(rocm completions bash)
# bash (system-wide; requires the bash-completion package)
rocm completions bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/rocm > /dev/null

# zsh (per-user; the directory must be on $fpath and compinit must run)
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
rocm completions zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_rocm
# then in ~/.zshrc, before `compinit`:
#   fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
#   autoload -Uz compinit && compinit

# fish
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
rocm completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/rocm.fish

# elvish (run once; re-running appends a duplicate block to rc.elv)
mkdir -p ~/.config/elvish
rocm completions elvish >> ~/.config/elvish/rc.elv

# powershell (current session only; to persist, append the output to $PROFILE)
rocm completions powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```
