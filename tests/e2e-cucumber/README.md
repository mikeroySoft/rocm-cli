# E2E Tests (cucumber-rs)

Behavioral end-to-end tests using [cucumber-rs](https://github.com/cucumber-rs/cucumber) — Gherkin `.feature` files backed by Rust step functions.

## Architecture

```
.feature files (Gherkin)  →  step functions (Rust)  →  rocm / configured rocmd / mock server
```

Scenarios exercise `rocm` and, where required, an explicitly configured
`rocmd` as black boxes — no imports from the rocm-cli codebase. Mock-tier tests
use an in-process axum server; GPU-tier tests run real model serving.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (cargo)
- For GPU-tier tests: an AMD GPU with ROCm drivers and `rocm` binary on PATH

## Directory layout

## Running tests

The `cargo xtask e2e` task builds the release `rocm` and `rocmd` binaries and
runs the suite. Extra arguments after `--` are forwarded to the cucumber CLI.

```bash
# All features:
cargo xtask e2e

# Filter by scenario name:
cargo xtask e2e -- -n "model name"

# Stop on first failure:
cargo xtask e2e -- --fail-fast

# With pre-built binaries (skips the build step):
ROCM_CLI_BINARY=./target/release/rocm \
ROCM_CLI_ROCMD_BINARY=./target/release/rocmd \
cargo xtask e2e
```

Prebuilt mode requires only `ROCM_CLI_BINARY` for scenarios that invoke
`rocm`. Scenarios backed by `rocmd`, such as artifact prefetch, additionally
require an explicit matching `ROCM_CLI_ROCMD_BINARY`; the harness does not
infer a sibling executable. Lifecycle packaging requires both prebuilt binaries
to be in the same directory because `xtask package` consumes one `ROCM_BIN_DIR`;
the harness rejects separate directories instead of silently packaging a
different `rocmd`.

The default run is fast: it excludes the expensive, OS-mutating `@lifecycle`
release-install scenarios (packaging + the real installer + install/uninstall).
Run only the matching lifecycle set for the current host through the harness:

```bash
E2E_INCLUDE_LIFECYCLE=1 E2E_ONLY_LIFECYCLE=1 cargo xtask e2e
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ROCM_CLI_BINARY` | `rocm` (on PATH) | Path to the rocm binary under test |
| `ROCM_CLI_ROCMD_BINARY` | set by `cargo xtask e2e` after its release build | Path to the rocmd binary required by rocmd-backed scenarios; explicit in prebuilt mode |
| `ROCM_CLI_CONFIG_DIR` | (temp dir) | Isolated config directory per scenario |
| `ROCM_CLI_DATA_DIR` | (temp dir) | Isolated data directory per scenario |
| `ROCM_CLI_CACHE_DIR` | (temp dir) | Isolated cache directory per scenario |

## Tags and per-scenario expectations

There is no tag-filter tiering. Each CI job runs the **whole** suite
(`cargo xtask e2e`, no `-t` filter); the harness resolves every scenario to
**pass / xfail / skip** at runtime from its capability tags plus the known-bug
matrix, then reconciles the actual result against that expectation.

### Naming

Each feature file has a short **key** that prefixes both its scenario names and
its ids. The key is usually the file's stem in kebab-case, but not always —
`install_lifecycle` uses `lifecycle`, `model_serving` uses `serve`, and
`dependency_guard` uses `deps-guard` — so `FEATURE_KEYS` in
`tests/feature_naming.rs` is the list, not this page.

Keys must also be **distinct between files**: `runtime_setup` owns `runtime`, so
`runtime_lifecycle` takes `runtime-lifecycle`. Two files sharing a key would emit
the same `<key>-01` index twice, which is exactly what the key exists to prevent.

- **Scenario name** — `Scenario: <key>-<NN> - <description>`, numbered
  sequentially in declaration order. The report sorts the grid's rows by this
  index, so it must match the order in the file. Without the key the index names
  nothing: every file used to number from 1, so "1" meant eight different
  scenarios.
- **`@id:`** — `<key>-<slug>`, so an id alone says which feature it belongs to.

`tests/feature_naming.rs` enforces all of this (sequential, unique suite-wide,
feature-qualified ids) in the ordinary `cargo test` run. Adding a feature file
means adding its key to `FEATURE_KEYS` there.

Scenarios carry stable-id and capability tags:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `@id:<key>-<slug>` | Stable scenario id, prefixed with its feature's key. Keys the expectation matrix and the report grid; every scenario has one. |
| `@requires-gpu` | Needs a usable AMD GPU. Resolves to **skip** (n/a) on a host with none — the mock job, or a WSL host whose ROCm passthrough is incomplete (`driver_status` other than `wsl_rocdxg_ready`), where the gfx target is reported but unreachable. |
| `@requires-multi-gpu` | Premise is a host with **more than one** AMD GPU present. Resolves to **skip** wherever the probed device count is not known to exceed one: a single-GPU host such as Strix Halo, and any host whose count could not be read (non-Linux, or WSL, which exposes neither a KFD topology nor an amdgpu DRM card). `@requires-gpu` cannot express this — it asks only whether *a* device is usable — so scenarios carry both. The count comes from the capability probe's `amd_gpu_count`, which mirrors the product's KFD+DRM rule rather than counting `amd-smi list` — the gate must ask the same "how many devices are present" question `--gpu` validation is built on, and `amd-smi` is only a best-effort fallback that may be absent or disagree. |
| `@requires-bare-metal` | Premise is a host running the in-tree amdgpu driver, so it does not hold under WSL2. Resolves to **skip** there. `@requires-os:linux` cannot express this: WSL2 reports an `os_family` of `linux`. |
| `@requires-wsl` | The inverse: premise **is** a WSL2 host. Resolves to **skip** on native Linux, native Windows, and everything else. |
| `@requires-engine:<vllm\|lemonade>` | Pins the serve engine. Resolves to skip where that engine can't start (e.g. vLLM on a lemonade-only Strix host). |
| `@requires-os:<linux\|windows>` | Premise is OS-specific; skip on other OSes. |
| `@serve-timeout:<secs>` | Lengthen the serve-readiness wait for a genuinely slow serve (e.g. a large model). |
| `@nightly` | Expensive scenario skipped by default; included when `E2E_INCLUDE_NIGHTLY=1`. |
| `@lifecycle` | Expensive, OS-mutating release-lifecycle scenario (packaging + real installer + install/uninstall). Skipped by default; included when `E2E_INCLUDE_LIFECYCLE=1`. `E2E_ONLY_LIFECYCLE=1` selects only this set without bypassing expectation resolution. |

Known bugs are **not** tagged in the `.feature` files — they live in
`expectations.toml`, keyed by `@id`, each with a `when = { ... }` condition (e.g.
`effective_engine = "vllm"`), a `bug` reference, and a `reason`. A scenario that
matches a condition is expected to fail (xfail); if it then passes, that is an
**XPASS**. Deterministic XPASS is stale and must be removed; entries marked
`flaky = true` tolerate either outcome while still reporting the intermittent
bug. See `src/expectation.rs` for the resolver and `expectations.toml`'s header
for the condition grammar.

On a GPU host, a `serve` precondition that never publishes its model is
relaunched once — but only for a scenario expected to pass; a known bug keeps its
shortened `serve_timeout_secs` and fails on the first attempt. The stalled
service is stopped (whole engine process tree) before the relaunch, so the second
serve does not compete with the first for device memory, and the failure quotes
the service log tail plus the device's free-VRAM state, which is where the
engine's own reason for the stall is recorded.

CI runs one job per platform, each executing the full suite. The mock job lives
in the `CI` workflow (`ci.yml`); the self-hosted GPU jobs live in a separate
`E2E self-hosted` workflow (`e2e-selfhosted.yml`) so a job queued on an offline
self-hosted runner can never stall `ci.yml`'s merge-required checks:

| Job | Workflow | Platform | Blocking |
|---|---|---|---|
| `e2e` | `ci.yml` | Mock (no GPU, GitHub-hosted) | yes |
| `e2e-gpu` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | MI300X (self-hosted) | no |
| `e2e-gpu-strix-ubuntu` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | Strix Halo / Ubuntu (self-hosted) | no |
| `e2e-gpu-strix-windows` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | Strix Halo / Windows (self-hosted) | no |
| `e2e-wsl` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | Strix Halo / Ubuntu under WSL2 (self-hosted) | no |
| `e2e-gpu-rad3` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | Radeon R9700 (self-hosted) | no |
| `e2e-gpu-mi350p` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | MI350P (self-hosted) | no |

The blocking mock job passes when every applicable scenario is pass-or-xfail with
no XPASS or unexpected failure; the GPU jobs are non-blocking. Each workflow
consolidates its own platforms: `ci.yml`'s `e2e-report` the mock platform,
`e2e-selfhosted.yml`'s `e2e-report` the self-hosted platforms, and
`nightly.yml`'s `e2e-report-nightly` the nightly lanes below. `e2e-wsl` runs the suite in an
Ubuntu distro under WSL2 on the Strix Halo box, so it is the only lane that
exercises `@requires-wsl` scenarios; `@requires-bare-metal` scenarios resolve to
skip there.

The nightly workflow covers the same hardware as the table above, as
non-blocking lanes (`e2e-gpu-nightly`, `e2e-gpu-nightly-rad3`,
`e2e-gpu-nightly-mi350p`, `e2e-gpu-nightly-strix`,
`e2e-gpu-nightly-strix-windows`, `e2e-wsl-nightly`) with
`E2E_INCLUDE_NIGHTLY=1`, then consolidates them into the same cross-platform
grid. The shared large-model scenario serves `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` through vLLM on
MI300X and the hardware-verified `unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`
checkpoint through Lemonade on Strix Halo.

Use the self-hosted E2E workflow dispatch to run either model independently on a
ref (the GPU platform / `include_nightly` / `name_filter` inputs live on
`e2e-selfhosted.yml`, not `ci.yml`):

```bash
# MI300X / vLLM / Qwen3.6-27B
gh workflow run e2e-selfhosted.yml --ref <ref> \
  -f platform=app-dev-gpu \
  -f include_nightly=true \
  -f name_filter='large platform-specific model'

# Strix Halo Linux / Lemonade / Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF (UD-Q4_K_XL)
gh workflow run e2e-selfhosted.yml --ref <ref> \
  -f platform=strix-ubuntu \
  -f include_nightly=true \
  -f name_filter='large platform-specific model'

# Strix Halo Windows / Lemonade / Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF (UD-Q4_K_XL)
gh workflow run e2e-selfhosted.yml --ref <ref> \
  -f platform=strix-windows \
  -f include_nightly=true \
  -f name_filter='large platform-specific model'
```

## From scenarios to tests

1. Write the `.feature` file with Gherkin scenarios (same words a user would use).
2. Add step functions in a `_steps.rs` file under `tests/e2e/`.
3. Add `pub mod <name>_steps;` to `tests/e2e.rs`.
4. Run with `cargo xtask e2e`.

The `.feature` file is both the spec and the test input — cucumber reads it at runtime and matches each step to a Rust function via `#[given]`/`#[when]`/`#[then]` annotations.

## Writing new tests

1. Write the Gherkin scenario in the appropriate `.feature` file (or create a new one for a new feature area).
2. Create a `_steps.rs` file if the feature area is new.
3. Implement step functions: Given = setup, When = action, Then = assertion.
4. Register the module in `tests/e2e.rs` with `pub mod <name>_steps;`.
5. Run to verify.

## Design principles

- **Black-box only.** Step functions interact with `rocm` and explicitly configured `rocmd` through their CLIs and HTTP endpoints. No imports from the rocm-cli codebase. Where a scenario needs the CLI to know about a running server, it plants a managed-service record as plain JSON matching the on-disk schema (see `register_mock_service`) — the same file `rocm serve --managed` would write — rather than importing the record type.
- **Isolated state.** Each scenario uses isolated config, data, and cache directories. Tests never touch `~/.rocm`.
- **Behavioral language.** Feature files describe what users care about, not implementation details. How steps are implemented (mock vs real, which port, which API) stays in the step functions.
- **OS-assigned ports.** The mock server binds to `127.0.0.1:0` to avoid port conflicts between tests.
- **A message is asserted with the state it describes.** A `Then` step matching printed output ("no existing SDK was found", "becomes the active default runtime", "stop them with `rocm services stop <id>`") asserts the resulting state in the same scenario — the file that was or was not written, the runtime that is or is not active, the advice's named command actually clearing the condition. Matching the text alone certifies the wording, not the truth of it, which is how a scenario passes over a CLI that is wrong about what it did. See AGENTS.md §3.

## The rocm-doctor skill contract

`rocm_doctor_skill.feature` is the one feature that treats a file in this repo as
an expected value. `skills/rocm-doctor/` is a published skill: this repo is its
source of truth, and the [`amd/skills`](https://github.com/amd/skills) catalog
vendors it from here. The skill owns no probe, no catalog and no fixes — all of
that ships inside the binary — so what it does own is a **contract**: which
fix-ids exist, which ones the CLI applies
itself, which machines each is for, which fields a diagnosis carries, which
confidence thresholds an agent reasons about, which verdicts `examine` can
return, and where a report goes when nothing matched.

`diagnose.feature` covers the same commands, so the division matters:

|  | expected value lives in | catches |
|---|---|---|
| `diagnose.feature` | the test suite (e.g. `CATALOG_FIX_IDS`) | the **CLI** drifting |
| `rocm_doctor_skill.feature` | `skills/rocm-doctor/reference.md` | the **document** drifting |

Only the second can notice that a published document has gone stale, and that is
the whole reason the feature exists. So anything already proven by
`diagnose.feature` — that a fix for another OS is declined without writing
anything, that the listing is complete, that a report says plainly whether a
cause was established — stays there and is **not** restated here. If a scenario
in this feature does not read `reference.md`, it is in the wrong file.

Reading that document as test data is a deliberate, narrow exception to
**Black-box only** above: nothing is imported from the rocm-cli codebase — a
*documentation artifact* is read as test data, and that artifact is the thing
under test. `skill_steps.rs` parses the specific claims each scenario names —
the catalog table's cells, the auto-applicable prose line, the framework-routing
bullets, the diagnose fields and thresholds — rather than restating them as
constants, so editing one of those in `reference.md` starts being checked with
no code change, and every one of those parsers asserts it found something — a
heading it depends on being reworded upstream must fail loudly rather than
quietly reduce an assertion to a no-op. Free-standing prose outside those
spots — the failure-mode count in the catalog heading, the Linux-only/
Windows-only recap line under the table, SKILL.md's "the other N are
print-only" — is not parsed, so it can drift without failing anything here.

Two rules follow:

- The catalog is authoritative in `crates/rocm-core/src/fix.rs`. When one of
  these scenarios fails, the CLI is right and the docs are what change.
- A skill-only edit must still run this job, so `skills/**` is in the `heavy`
  paths filter that gates the `e2e` job.

No scenario asserts whether a symptom matched, in either direction — that is not
a property this suite can hold still. The catalog scores several checkers from
**host state alone**, with no symptom keyword involved, so a runner with `amdgpu`
blacklisted is explained by `fix-5-amdgpu-load` whatever it is asked about; and
on a host the catalog rules out of scope (WSL2) nothing is scored at all. An
assertion either way would encode one runner's state.

Claims about *whether* a cause was established therefore live in
`crates/rocm-core/src/diagnose.rs`, where the `Examination` is constructed rather
than probed. What this feature asserts holds on any host, so it is clean on WSL2,
the no-GPU lane, and the GPU lanes alike.
