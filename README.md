        Local AI on AMD GPUs — one binary, zero setup
```

ROCm CLI is a command-line tool for setting up and running local AI on AMD GPUs, with a
full-screen TUI dashboard for GPU telemetry, model serving, and chat.

It ships as a single prebuilt binary for Linux and Windows (x86_64), needs no
Python, Rust, or existing ROCm install, and includes inference engine adapters
for Lemonade and vLLM.

<!-- platform-support-table-start -->
| Platform | Prebuilt binary | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linux (x86_64) | Yes | Ubuntu 24.04 or newer; full support, including the live dashboard and both inference engines |
| Windows (x86_64) | Yes | CLI and Lemonade serving; no live dashboard or vLLM |
| WSL2 (x86_64) | Yes (Linux binary) | Ubuntu 24.04 or newer; full support, including the live dashboard; see [docs/wsl.md](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/blob/main/docs/wsl.md) for setup |
| macOS | No | No official installer, release, CI, or QA coverage |
<!-- platform-support-table-end -->

Live dashboard telemetry requires Linux or WSL2 (see
[Interactive interfaces](#interactive-interfaces)). vLLM serving is Linux or WSL2
only (see [docs/vllm.md](docs/vllm.md)).

The minimum supported Linux release, native or under WSL2, is Ubuntu 24.04. On
other distributions the equivalent requirement is glibc 2.38 with
`GLIBCXX_3.4.32`: that is what the Lemonade engine is linked against, and every
published build of it needs those versions, so there is no older release to fall
back to. Ubuntu 22.04 ships glibc 2.35 and cannot run it; Ubuntu 24.04 provides
glibc 2.39 and `GLIBCXX_3.4.33`.

## Installation

The installer downloads a prebuilt bundle, verifies its SHA-256 checksum,
installs the `rocm` and `rocmd` binaries into `~/.local/bin`, and adds that
directory to your shell `PATH`. Rerun it any time to upgrade.

### Linux and WSL (x86_64)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

This tracks the default `release` channel. For nightly builds, pass the
`nightly` channel instead:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/main/install.sh | sh -s -- nightly
```

### Windows (x86_64, PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

This tracks the default `release` channel. For nightly builds, set
`ROCM_CLI_CHANNEL` to `nightly` first:

```powershell
$env:ROCM_CLI_CHANNEL = "nightly"
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Build from source

Building requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/); the pinned toolchain in
`rust-toolchain.toml` (currently 1.96.0) installs automatically via `rustup`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-cli
cd rocm-cli
cargo build --release
```

This produces the two binaries under `target/release/`:

- `rocm` — the CLI and interactive interfaces
- `rocmd` — the background telemetry daemon used by the dashboard

Run without installing:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin rocm -- examine
```

Or copy the release binaries onto your `PATH`:

```bash
install -m 0755 target/release/rocm target/release/rocmd ~/.local/bin/
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full development setup, test
commands, and commit-signing requirements.

## First run

Launch ROCm CLI with no arguments:

```
rocm
```

With no arguments on an interactive terminal, `rocm` opens the **launcher** — a
small front-door menu that gets you to the common tasks:

- **Set up this system** — install or update ROCm
- **Serve a model** — run a model on your GPU
- **Diagnose & fix** — check GPU, driver, and ROCm
- **Chat** — talk to a local or API-backed model
- **Open full dashboard →** — escalate into the live dashboard (`rocm dash`)

Pick a row with the arrow keys and `Enter`; press `q` — or `Ctrl-C`, which quits
from the launcher and the dashboard alike and restores your terminal — to quit.
The one exception is the dashboard's console for a **running** job, where
`Ctrl-C` keeps its existing meaning of "cancel this job" and does not quit; once
that job finishes, `Ctrl-C` quits there too. On a non-interactive terminal (or
piped output), `rocm` prints a one-shot status summary instead of opening the
launcher.

## Interactive interfaces

`rocm` ships two terminal UIs built on [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/):

### The launcher (`rocm`)

The lightweight hub described above. It runs the guided **Set up**, **Serve**,
**Diagnose**, and **Chat** flows in place, and hands off to the full dashboard
when you need live instruments. This is the default surface for everyday use;
the legacy full-screen setup assistant has been retired.

### The dashboard (`rocm dash`)

The full-screen telemetry dashboard — every instrument and action on one screen.
It auto-starts an embedded `rocmd` daemon when none is running, then presents
five tabs (switch with `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` or number keys `1`–`5`):

| Tab | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Home** | At-a-glance status: GPU, active runtime, running servers |
| **ROCm** | Guided ROCm and runtime actions with inline details |
| **Serving** | Start, inspect, and manage model servers |
| **Observe** | Live GPU utilization, instances, and benchmark telemetry |
| **Chat** | Assistant chat backed by a local server or configured provider |

Live mode reads telemetry over a Unix domain socket, so it requires Linux or
WSL. Use `rocm dash --demo` for a synthetic session that runs anywhere without a
GPU or daemon.

## Configure ROCm and serve a model

Before serving a model, ensure a managed ROCm runtime is configured:

```
rocm install sdk
```

This downloads TheRock ROCm wheels and a matching PyTorch stack into a managed
environment. On machines with an existing ROCm install, `rocm examine` will
show it as `legacy_rocm_status: detected_unmanaged` — running `rocm install sdk`
creates a separate managed runtime alongside it. Running the command when a
managed runtime is already the active default asks first, because the new
install takes over as the active default; see
[ROCm installation](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-cli/blob/main/README.md#rocm-installation)
for that gate and the flags that approve it without a prompt.

Then serve a model:

```
rocm serve qwen
```

`qwen` is a built-in alias for a small assistant model that serves out of the
box. You can also serve any compatible Hugging Face model directly — see
[Model serving](#model-serving) for the GGUF-vs-safetensors rule, since which
form works depends on the engine your GPU selects.

## Commands

### Examine

```
rocm examine [--json] [--framework auto|pytorch|llama-cpp|skip]
```

Checks this computer's GPU, ROCm install, engines, and managed setup
folders — the command to run first to see whether a system is ready, and
what `rocm install sdk` and `rocm serve` will see. `--json` emits a
machine-readable report for diagnosis tooling instead of the human-readable
summary. `--framework` controls which ML framework the `--json` report probes
for its ROCm build and compiled GPU architectures: `auto` (the default) tries
PyTorch, then falls back to llama.cpp; `pytorch` or `llama-cpp` probe only
that framework; `skip` runs no framework probe at all, which is fastest and
still enough to answer GPU and driver questions. `--framework` only affects
the JSON report, not the human-readable one.

### Diagnose and fix

```
rocm diagnose [--symptom TEXT] [--top N] [--json] [--distro [NAME]]
rocm fix [<fix-id>] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--device-index N]
```

`diagnose` matches this machine against a fixed catalog of known
ROCm/PyTorch/llama.cpp misconfigurations and ranks what it finds. It can only
recognise failure modes that are in the catalog: no match means "not
recognised", not "nothing is wrong" — in that case it points you at where to
report the symptom. Each result prints an `id:` and an `apply with:` command;
the leading `#1`, `#2` are ranking positions for reading order only — `rocm
fix` takes the id, not the position.

- `--symptom` takes raw error text to sharpen keyword scoring.
- `--top` caps how many matches are shown in the human-readable output
  (default 5) — `--json` always emits the full, untruncated report.
- `--distro` diagnoses a WSL distribution from the Windows host instead of
  this machine (nothing needs to be installed inside the distribution — name
  it only when more than one is installed). Inspecting remotely this way
  skips checks that need to read the distribution's own environment
  (`HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION`, `PATH`, the framework/ROCm pairing) — run
  `rocm diagnose` inside the distribution for those.

`fix` applies a known fix by the `id:` that `diagnose` reported — not the
ranking position noted above, which isn't a stable name. Run it with no id
to list the whole catalog. Each fix is marked AUTO (this command carries out
the change) or PRINT-ONLY (it prints the steps for you to run yourself —
usually because the right command depends on a choice only you can make,
sometimes because it also needs sudo or a reboot).

- `--dry-run` shows any fix's plan without changing anything.
- `--yes` skips the interactive confirmation once you've reviewed it.
- `--device-index` pins the discrete GPU index for `fix-9-igpu-dgpu`;
  without it, that fix only prints the `rocminfo` (Linux) or `hipInfo.exe`
  (Windows) query needed to find the index and makes no change, despite
  being marked AUTO.

### ROCm installation

```
rocm install sdk    [--channel release|nightly] [--format wheel|tarball]
                    [--version x.y.z | --build-date YYYY-MM-DD]
                    [--family gfx110X-all] [--prefix PATH] [--dry-run]
                    [--approve-replacing-active-default] [--yes]

rocm install driver [--dkms] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--reconcile]

rocm update         [--apply] [--runtime KEY] [--activate] [--dry-run]
                    [--json] [--timeout-secs SECS] [--yes]
```

`install sdk` downloads TheRock ROCm wheels into a Python environment managed
by rocm-cli. An install with no active default runtime never prompts, but once a
managed runtime is the active default every `install sdk` asks first, because
the new install takes over as the active default. That gate is not scoped to the
family or channel you are installing: a `--family` or `--channel` you have never
installed before takes over the active default just as a same-family upgrade
does, so it asks too. To approve that non-interactively — in scripts or CI, where
the prompt would otherwise refuse — pass `--approve-replacing-active-default`,
which is also what the refusal itself recommends and what ROCm CLI's own
non-interactive surfaces (chat, MCP, the dashboard) pass. `--yes` grants the same
approval *and* approves installing required system packages (such as OpenMPI for
vLLM), which means `sudo`; reach for it only where something can answer a sudo
password prompt — which an unattended job cannot, unless it has passwordless sudo
configured. In the default managed install root, the root and its manifest are
keyed by version, so an upgrade or downgrade keeps the previous install on disk
and only a same-version reinstall reuses the same root. `--prefix` opts out of
that: the folder you name is used verbatim for every version, so successive
installs into one prefix replace each other in place — and if the venv already
there no longer runs its own Python, it is removed outright and rebuilt. The
consent gate does not cover that: it asks about changing the active default
runtime, not about what a named prefix loses. `install driver` installs the AMD
kernel driver on Linux (DKMS or native package). `update` checks for a newer
ROCm package; pass `--apply` to install it, or `--dry-run` to preview what
`--apply` would do without changing anything (`--dry-run` does not require
`--apply`). `--runtime` and `--activate` require `--apply` or `--dry-run` — pass
one of those instead of naming a runtime or requesting activation on its own.
`--json` prints the check result as a single line of JSON instead of text;
`--timeout-secs` bounds its network calls (`--timeout-secs` requires `--json`;
both `--json` and `--timeout-secs` conflict with `--apply`, and `--json` also
conflicts with `--dry-run`). `update --apply` never prompts and needs no
approval flag: selecting a runtime to update is itself the approval, and it
leaves the active default alone unless you add `--activate`. `update` does
accept `--yes`, for consistency with other mutating commands, but it grants
nothing there — the approval line the update path prints never credits it.

ROCm 10 and newer ship from a different source layout. It is opt-in, and asking
for it takes two things together: pin the version with `--version`, and name the
exact GPU arch — the raw `gfx` code, not a family label:

```
rocm install sdk --version 10.0.0 --family gfx1200 --dry-run
```

A family label such as `--family gfx120X-all` is rejected for those versions
rather than resolved to a guess, because the ROCm 10 packages publish one
payload per exact arch and there is no bucket payload to fall back to. Run
`rocm examine` to see the arch this machine reports.

For ROCm 10, `install sdk` asks `uv` to resolve Torch, torchvision, and
torchaudio from their published dependency metadata, then validates that every
selected framework package carries the same ROCm build identifier before it
creates or changes a managed runtime.

Nothing about this happens on its own. Without a `--version` of 10 or newer,
`install sdk` resolves the same release and nightly sources it always has, and
it never quietly retries against the ROCm 10 sources when a lookup comes up
empty — it tells you what it could not find instead.

### Runtime management

Manage multiple side-by-side ROCm runtimes:

```
rocm runtimes list
rocm runtimes activate <runtime-key>
rocm runtimes rollback
rocm runtimes uninstall <runtime-key> [--yes] [--dry-run]
rocm runtimes import <manifest-file> [--replace]
rocm runtimes adopt --python <path> [--root <path>] [--runtime-id ID]
                    [--runtime-key KEY] [--channel LABEL] [--replace]
rocm runtimes adopt-system [--root <path>] [--runtime-id ID]
                           [--runtime-key KEY] [--activate] [--replace]
```

`uninstall` prompts for confirmation unless `--yes` is passed; outside an
interactive terminal `--yes` is required. `--dry-run` prints the plan and
exits without prompting or making changes.

`adopt` registers an existing TheRock-based Python environment as a read-only
runtime.

`adopt-system` registers an already-installed system ROCm SDK (a standard
package install such as `/opt/rocm`) as a read-only runtime, without
downloading anything or writing into the SDK tree. The root is detected via
`ROCM_PATH`, `ROCM_HOME`, or `HIP_PATH`, falling back to `/opt/rocm`; pass
`--root` to override. `--activate` makes it the default runtime and completes
first-time setup. Linux and WSL only in this release.

System runtimes are owned by the OS package manager: implicit `rocm update`
skips them, while `rocm update --runtime <system-key>` directs you to your
distribution's tooling. After updating ROCm there, re-run `adopt-system`; pass
the original `--runtime-key` with `--replace` to refresh that existing record.
`rocm runtimes uninstall` only unregisters the record — the SDK itself is
left untouched. A system SDK has no managed Python environment, so it is never
auto-selected for engine installs: Lemonade installs into its own managed
environment and works normally, while a vLLM install needs a runtime from
`rocm install sdk` (or an existing external vLLM via `ROCM_CLI_VLLM_PYTHON`).

### Disk space

Each ROCm CLI-managed SDK install keeps its own multi-gigabyte folder, so
installing or updating a few times adds up. `rocm storage` shows where the
space went and frees the parts that are safe to remove:

```
rocm storage [report] [--json]
rocm storage remove-old-installs [--keep N] [--dry-run] [--yes]
rocm storage remove-downloads [--dry-run] [--yes]
```

`remove-old-installs` keeps the two most recent installs for each channel,
format, and GPU family, and never touches the install in use, the rollback
target, or a folder rocm-cli did not create. "Most recent" means most recently
installed rather than highest version, so after a deliberate downgrade the
older version counts as the newer install. Because the count applies per
channel, format, and GPU family, a machine that has tried several channels
keeps `--keep` installs for each of them. Anything it declines to remove is
listed with the reason, and `--dry-run` shows the whole plan without changing
anything. `remove-downloads` clears cached archives that rocm-cli can download
again; a cache folder that is a link to somewhere else is left alone rather
than followed. The report also lists the
`uv` package cache and downloaded models; those are shared with other tools
and are never removed by rocm-cli.

### Inference engines

```
rocm engines list
rocm engines install <engine> [--runtime-id KEY] [--python-version X.Y] [--reinstall]
rocm engines shell <engine>   [--runtime-id KEY | --env-id ID] [--shell PATH]
```

Supported engines: `lemonade`, `vllm`.

### Model serving

Start a local OpenAI-compatible model server:

```
rocm serve <model> [--engine lemonade|vllm]
                   [--device gpu_required|gpu_preferred]
                   [--gpu auto|<index>]
                   [--runtime-id KEY | --env-id ID]
                   [--host HOST] [--port PORT]
                   [--verbose] [--foreground | --managed]
                   [--no-smoke-test]
                   [--allow-public-bind]
                   [--temperature TEMP] [--top-p PROB] [--max-tokens N]
```

`--temperature` (>= 0.0), `--top-p` (0.0-1.0), and `--max-tokens` (> 0) set
server-wide sampling defaults for the launched engine. They apply only to
`vllm` and `lemonade`; other engines reject them. For vLLM they are folded
into a single `--override-generation-config` JSON object (`--max-tokens` maps
to vLLM's `max_new_tokens`); for Lemonade they pass straight through as
llama.cpp's `--temperature`, `--top-p`, and `--n-predict` flags. Each control
is optional and independent — omit any of them to keep the engine's own
default.

`rocm serve` only reuses an already-running service for the same engine and
model if its sampling controls (and other recipe settings) match the ones
requested this time; otherwise it errors out instead of silently serving with
different settings. If you previously started a service with `--temperature`
(or another sampling flag) and now run `rocm serve` for the same model without
flags — or with different ones — stop the existing service first (`rocm
services stop`) or match the original flags.

By default the server runs in the background under rocm-cli's supervision and
prints a deployment summary — a progress indicator while it starts, then a table
with the status, the full inference endpoint, the API-qualified model name, and a
quick smoke test (time to first token and approximate tokens/sec). Control
returns to your shell with the server still running; manage it later with `rocm
services` (below).

`--verbose` (or `--foreground`) instead attaches to the server in the current
terminal and streams every engine log line — use it to debug a startup problem.
The server still runs as a managed background process, so while streaming you can
press **Ctrl-D to detach** — the log stream stops, your shell comes back, and the
server keeps running (manage it afterward with `rocm services`). Press **Ctrl-C**
to stop the server instead. `--managed` is the explicit form of the default
background behavior. `--no-smoke-test` skips the post-startup inference probe.

Which model form to pass depends on the engine your GPU selects. The Lemonade
engine (Ryzen AI or Radeon) serves llama.cpp **GGUF** models — pass a GGUF repo
with an explicit quantization variant, for example,
`rocm serve unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF:Q4_0`. The vLLM engine (Instinct) serves
**safetensors** repos, such as `rocm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`. A
safetensors-only id has no GGUF build, so serving it through Lemonade fails
rather than silently substituting a different model.

Some models (such as Llama) are gated and require HuggingFace authentication.
Log in with `huggingface-cli login` or set `HF_TOKEN` in your environment
before serving gated models.

`--gpu` selects which AMD GPU the server runs on. `auto` (the default) probes
per-GPU VRAM with `amd-smi` and picks the lowest-numbered GPU that is idle and
not already used by another rocm-cli server (managed or foreground), falling
back to the GPU with the most free memory. Pass a single index (`--gpu 1`) to
pin a specific device. The
selected GPU is exposed to the engine via `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. Serving one
model across multiple GPUs is not supported. Because selection uses the
`amd-smi` ordinal but is applied via `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, rocm-cli warns when
`ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is set, since the two orderings can diverge.

Manage background servers started with `--managed`:

```
rocm services list [--all]
rocm services logs <service-id>
rocm services stop <service-id> [--yes]
rocm services restart <service-id> [--yes]
rocm services remove <service-id> --yes
rocm services prune [--older-than-hours <n> | --any-age] [--dry-run] [--yes]
```

`remove` deletes one record that is no longer running, together with its log,
its engine state file, and its endpoint key file; a running server is refused,
so stop it first. `prune` does the same in bulk, always leaves running servers
alone, and additionally clears leftover files whose record is already gone.
Removal destroys both the log and the `restart` option for the records it
takes, so `prune` only considers records untouched for 24 hours. Age is
measured from when the record file was last written, so a stop, a restart, or a
status correction all count as touching it. Pass `--older-than-hours <n>` for a
different threshold, or `--any-age` to take every record that is not running
however recent — that is the flag `prune` names in its own summary when it
reports how many records it kept for being too recent. The two cannot be
combined.

### Dashboard

```
rocm dash [--demo] [--replay <file>]
```

Full-screen TUI with Home, ROCm, Serving, Observe, and Chat tabs — GPU
utilization graphs, active serving instances, benchmark results, guided actions,
and a chat tab backed by any configured provider. See
[Interactive interfaces](#interactive-interfaces) for the tab breakdown.

- `--demo` runs a deterministic synthetic session with no GPU or daemon needed,
  works on all platforms.
- `--replay <file>` replays a recorded NDJSON session.
- Live mode requires Unix domain sockets (Linux and WSL only).

### Bench

```
rocm bench load --endpoint URL [--model NAME] [--concurrency N,N,...]
                [--isl N] [--osl N] [--requests N] [--out FILE] [--auto-ramp]
```

Saturates a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint and reports rough client-side
throughput — a local smoke test, **not** an official ROCm/AMD benchmark.
`load` measures raw serving throughput with synthetic single-shot requests
(the vLLM `benchmark_serving` shape); it does not reproduce agent-shaped,
multi-turn, long-context tool traffic and isn't comparable to `*-agent-bench`
quality harnesses.

- `--endpoint` is the OpenAI-compatible URL shown by `rocm services list` (a
  plain host address without `/v1` also works); only `http://` is accepted —
  `https://` endpoints are rejected outright, since the load generator has no
  TLS backend compiled in.
- `--concurrency` sweeps a comma-separated list of levels (default
  `1,8,32,64`, each 1-128); `--auto-ramp` ignores `--concurrency` and instead
  ramps `1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128` automatically, stopping early once generation
  throughput plateaus or the request queue backs up.
- `--isl`/`--osl` (input/output sequence length, default 1024 each) accept
  1-32768, and `--requests` (default 128) accepts 1-10000.
- Results are written to `--out` (default `<data-dir>/bench/results.csv`,
  where `<data-dir>` is `~/.rocm` unless overridden), intended to match the
  path the daemon tails to feed the dashboard's **Observe** tab. The CLI's
  default output path and the daemon's tailed path are computed
  independently, so if either the CLI's data dir or the daemon's
  `bench_results_dir` config has been customized, confirm they still point
  at the same file.

### Chat

```
rocm chat [--provider anthropic|openai|...] [--model NAME] [--prompt TEXT] [--tools]
          [--temperature TEMP] [--top-p PROB] [--max-tokens N]
```

Chat with an AI provider from the terminal. Reads from stdin when `--prompt` is
omitted. `--temperature`, `--top-p`, and `--max-tokens` are optional sampling
controls forwarded to the request; each is independent, so omit any of them to
use the provider's default.

### Agent harnesses

Configure supported agent CLIs to use a local ROCm model server:

```
rocm agents
rocm agents <agent>
rocm agents <agent> --setup --dry-run [--model MODEL] [--base-url URL]
                    [--agent-version VERSION]
rocm agents <agent> --setup --yes [--model MODEL] [--base-url URL]
                    [--agent-version VERSION] [--no-check]
rocm agents <agent> --test [--agent-version VERSION]
```

Supported harness names are `claude`, `hermes`, `openclaw`, `codex`,
`opencode`, `qwen-code`, `aider`, `continue`, `pi`, and `omp`; `rocm agents`
lists all ten with installation and configuration status. Pi is the Earendil
Works Pi coding agent (`pi` executable), while OMP is Oh My Pi (`omp`
executable): they are separate canonical harnesses and neither name is an
alias for the other. Pi setup supports exactly version `0.84.4`; OMP setup
supports major version `18`.

`rocm agents <agent>` inspects one harness without changing it, including its
detected executable, version, configuration paths, endpoint, and model. Use
`--agent-version` to select a supported configuration schema explicitly,
including when preparing setup before the harness is installed.

Pi setup updates two user-level files under
`${PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR:-~/.pi/agent}`. `models.json` gets a
`providers.rocm-local` Chat Completions provider with the loopback base URL,
the placeholder local API key `rocm-local`, and the selected model;
`settings.json` gets `defaultProvider` and `defaultModel`. A project
`.pi/settings.json` or an explicit CLI/session selection has higher precedence,
so setup warns about project settings and changes only the user files.

OMP setup always adds the unauthenticated `rocm-local` Chat Completions
provider and model to the active profile's user-level `models.yml`. After a
successful registration and protocol check, interactive setup asks whether to
set `modelRoles.default` in `config.yml` to `rocm-local/<model>` for new OMP
sessions. Declining, running noninteractively with `--yes`, or using
`--dry-run` leaves the existing default unchanged; rerun setup interactively
to choose it later. Dry-run reports that default selection follows an applied
setup. The default agent root is `~/.omp/agent`; `PI_CONFIG_DIR` changes the
`.omp` root, and `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` replaces the default profile's full
agent directory. A profile selected by `--profile` or `OMP_PROFILE` (preferred
over legacy `PI_PROFILE`) instead uses `<root>/profiles/<name>/agent`. Setup
changes only that active profile's user files. Project `.omp/config.yml`,
`PI_CONFIG_FILES` overlays, repeated `--config` overlays, and runtime `--model`
can override the effective model; later overlays win, so OMP setup warns when
they may take precedence.

Pi setup applies its two user files as one transaction. Both targets are
checked for symlinks and stale plans, replacements are atomic and ordered, a
partial apply restores earlier files, and full rollback restores files in
reverse order. OMP registers `models.yml` first and applies the optional
`config.yml` default separately only after the interactive choice.

Setup automatically uses the unique ready loopback service managed by
rocm-cli. `--model` selects a matching service when several are ready. If no
managed service matches, setup falls back to
`http://127.0.0.1:11435/v1`; supply `--model` for an offline setup plan, or
start a server with `rocm serve <model>`. An explicit `--base-url` must be a
loopback HTTP URL; if `--model` is omitted, the endpoint must advertise one
unambiguous model.

`--dry-run` prints the target and file changes without writing them. A normal
setup prompts before writing; `--yes` supplies that approval for scripts and
other non-interactive use, but does not select OMP's optional default. After
writing, setup probes the harness's native API route with the exact model and
restores the previous configuration if the check fails. `--no-check`
deliberately keeps the configuration without making that protocol request.

`--test` runs the installed harness against a nonce probe in an isolated
temporary workspace using harness-specific safe arguments and the configured
model. It verifies the probe remains intact and the nonce appears in the
harness's final output, without exposing the caller's repository. Pi is pinned
to the selected provider, model, and placeholder API key with offline and
resource-discovery restrictions. OMP uses noninteractive print mode with an
`@probe.txt` prompt, disables tools, sessions, titles, LSP, PTY, extensions,
skills, and rules, and applies a bounded maximum time. Harnesses may create
ordinary cache or session files inside the temporary workspace.

### ComfyUI

Install and manage ComfyUI for image generation (alias: `rocm comfy`):

```
rocm comfyui install    [--runtime-id KEY] [--reinstall] [--dry-run] [--yes]
rocm comfyui start      [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--no-open-browser] [--yes]
rocm comfyui stop       [--yes]
rocm comfyui status
rocm comfyui logs       [--lines N]
rocm comfyui models-path
```

None of `install`, `start`, or `stop` ever prompt for confirmation; `--yes` is
accepted on each for consistency with other mutating commands but currently
has no effect.

### Automations

```
rocm automations list
rocm automations enable <watcher-id>  [--mode observe|propose|contained]
rocm automations disable <watcher-id>
```

Optional background checks that can propose or apply changes automatically.

### Configuration

Show or change rocm-cli's saved settings — the default engine and runtime,
which runtime each engine prefers, local GPU telemetry opt-in, and the
provider used for chat, automations, and ambiguous natural-language plans
(including enabling providers and storing their API keys).

```
rocm config show
rocm config set-default-engine <engine>
rocm config clear-default-engine
rocm config set-default-runtime <runtime-id>
rocm config clear-default-runtime
rocm config set-engine <engine> [--runtime-id KEY | --env-id ID | --clear]
rocm config set-telemetry local|off
rocm config set-planner-provider <provider>
rocm config clear-planner-provider
rocm config enable-provider <provider>
rocm config disable-provider <provider>
rocm config set-provider-key <provider>
rocm config clear-provider-key <provider>
```

### Setup

```
rocm setup status
rocm setup reset
```

Manage first-time setup state. `status` shows whether first-time setup has
completed; `reset` clears the recorded completed/dismissed state (nothing
auto-triggers onboarding from this alone — open it manually from the
dashboard, `rocm dash`: switch to the **Observe** tab, then press `n`). ROCm
installs, API keys, and provider settings are left untouched.

### Logs and cleanup

```
rocm logs [--service <service-id>] [--search TERM ...]

rocm uninstall [--yes] [--dry-run]
               [--keep-binaries] [--keep-config] [--keep-data] [--keep-cache]
```

### Shell completions

`rocm completions <shell>` prints a completion script for the given shell to
stdout. Supported shells are `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `elvish`, and `powershell`.

```
rocm completions <bash|zsh|fish|elvish|powershell>
```

Install the script for your shell:

```
# bash (per-user, no sudo; add this line to ~/.bashrc to persist)
source <(rocm completions bash)
# bash (system-wide; requires the bash-completion package)
rocm completions bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/rocm > /dev/null

# zsh (per-user; the directory must be on $fpath and compinit must run)
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
rocm completions zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_rocm
# then in ~/.zshrc, before `compinit`:
#   fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
#   autoload -Uz compinit && compinit

# fish
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
rocm completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/rocm.fish

# elvish (run once; re-running appends a duplicate block to rc.elv)
mkdir -p ~/.config/elvish
rocm completions elvish >> ~/.config/elvish/rc.elv

# powershell (current session only; to persist, append the output to $PROFILE)
rocm completions powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```
