    // We use a response delay that grows with each call so earlier concurrency
    // levels complete fewer tokens per second than later ones.  The trick: use a
    // wiremock `up_to_n_times` chain of stubs with decreasing delay so the mock
    // server delivers progressively faster responses, making gen_tps rise
    // monotonically and preventing the plateau check from firing until the last
    // element (128) of RAMP_SEQUENCE is reached.
    //
    // Because accurate per-call timing in a test is fragile, we instead use a
    // simpler approach: a single stub that always responds with the same tokens
    // but with a very short delay, and set spec.requests = 1 so each cell has
    // exactly 1 request. With 1 request per cell and flat token counts the gen_tps
    // will be approximately 1/wall which varies by wall time — we can't guarantee
    // monotonic growth.
    //
    // Instead, we use the queue-backed-up exit condition to test the cap: set
    // max_waiting >= max_running via Prometheus.  But that only works if Prom is up.
    //
    // Simplest approach: test the cap path directly by verifying that with a
    // strictly rising gen_tps signal, the ramp runs all the way to the last
    // RAMP_SEQUENCE entry (128). We simulate this by setting requests=1 and using
    // a delay that decreases per-cell, ensuring each successive cell is faster.
    //
    // Since we can't easily make gen_tps strictly increase with a real HTTP mock
    // (wall time is non-deterministic), we use a different angle: verify that when
    // NO plateau and NO queue-full ever triggers, the ramp hits exactly 128.
    // We achieve this by making each request take 0ms (no delay) — but with 1
    // request per cell the gen_tps may still vary.  The reliable invariant is:
    // the last row's concurrency == 128 when the stop condition never fires early.
    //
    // We enforce "no early stop" by using enough requests (spec.requests = 64)
    // that each cell's gen_tps has a chance to grow (more concurrent = more TPS),
