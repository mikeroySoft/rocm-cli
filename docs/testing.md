# Testing

This page collects developer verification commands. The README stays focused on quick-start usage.

## Local Verification

Run the Rust test suite:

```bash
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
```

Run clippy with warnings as errors:

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Run the cross-platform smoke test:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_local.py
```

If the workspace is already built:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_local.py --skip-build
```

## CI test selection

On pull requests, CI does not test the whole workspace. The `test` job runs
`cargo nextest run` over only the crates a change can reach — the changed crates
plus their transitive dependents, derived from the workspace dependency graph by:

```bash
cargo xtask affected --base origin/main
```

which prints the cargo package flags to test (`--workspace`, or `-p <crate> …`,
or nothing when no crate is affected). It falls back to `--workspace` for any
change that can't be confined to specific crates (the lockfile, the toolchain
file, the workspace root manifest, or CI config). On `main` and in the merge
queue the full workspace always runs. For local verification, keep using
`cargo test --workspace --all-targets` above — `affected` is a CI optimization.

The smoke path is the cross-platform local no-fallback acceptance surface. It
uses an isolated config/data/cache root, does not install TheRock wheels, does
not require a managed runtime, and verifies:

- first-run examine and engine inventory state
- telemetry-off config behavior
- GPU-required recipe planning for `tiny-gpt2`
- exact-runtime rejection for `rocm engines install` before any runtime exists
- direct vLLM adapter and `rocm serve` CPU policy rejection
- GPU-required paths fail loudly instead of silently falling back
- no first-run pip cache or runtime registry is created

Build the platform-native release artifact:

```bash
python scripts/build_single_exe_release.py standalone
```

On Windows this writes `.rocm-work/standalone-release/rocm.exe`; on Linux it
writes `.rocm-work/standalone-release/rocm`. The artifact is the rocm-cli binary
itself, not a self-extracting launcher and not a model bundle. Running it with
no arguments opens normal rocm-cli; if setup is not complete, the first-time
setup wizard appears automatically.

rocm-cli ships native per-OS binaries; there is no cross-OS universal binary.
Build and test the binary natively on each supported target (native Windows,
Ubuntu/Fedora on WSL, and Linux on server/bare-metal):

```bash
cargo build --workspace --release
cargo test --workspace
```

On WSL/Linux, build and run the native Linux binary directly. The examine
output on WSL must include `os: linux` and `wsl: true`, and must not include
`os: windows`.

Use isolated `ROCM_CLI_CONFIG_DIR`, `ROCM_CLI_DATA_DIR`, and
`ROCM_CLI_CACHE_DIR` roots for smoke tests, then delete those roots after the
test so the user's real `.rocm` state stays clean.

Focused examine guidance coverage:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm-core examine_render
cargo test -p rocm-core managed_sdk_probe
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm examine_runtime_state_reports_ambiguous_default_runtime_id
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm engine_runtime_selection_rejects_ambiguous_default_runtime_id
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm permissions_
```

Self-hosted GPU CI smoke is intentionally non-mutating. The MI300X job builds
the workspace, runs `rocm examine`, then runs `detect` and `capabilities` for
all first-party engine adapters: Lemonade and vLLM.
Live serving acceptance remains separate because it needs engine-specific
runtime installs, model artifacts, and supported upstream GPU targets.

WSL live examine sanity after building with a Linux target directory:

```bash
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/home/user/.cache/rocm-cli-target
cargo build --workspace
rocm examine
```

Expected WSL fields when a managed TheRock runtime is registered and ROCDXG is
ready:

- `detected_gfx_target: gfxNNNN` from sysfs, PATH ROCm tools, or the managed
  TheRock SDK tool path recorded in the runtime registry
- `compatible_therock_family: ...`
- `active_runtime_status: ready`, `unset`, `missing_manifest`, or
  `ambiguous_runtime_id`
- if ambiguous, `active_runtime_matches` plus the exact
  `rocm runtimes activate <runtime_key>` action

Ambiguous runtime selectors should also fail before engine install or serve
launches:

```bash
rocm engines install vllm
rocm serve qwen --engine vllm --managed
```

On a host where `default_runtime_id` matches multiple registered runtime keys,
both commands should report the matching runtime keys and ask for
`rocm runtimes activate <runtime_key>` or an explicit runtime key.

Focused TheRock metadata cache coverage:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm metadata_cache
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm metadata_signature_verification_accepts_generated_key_and_rejects_tamper
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm http_header_value
rocm install sdk --channel release --format wheel --dry-run
```

## Agent Harness Setup E2E

The `rocm agents` behavior spec is
[`agents.feature`](../tests/e2e-cucumber/features/agents.feature). Run the
default mock scenarios through the existing E2E workflow:

```bash
E2E_ONLY_AGENTS=1 cargo xtask e2e
```

The focused selector stays inside the suite's expectation and capability
resolver. Do not select this feature with cucumber `--tags` or `-n`; those
filters bypass that resolver.

The mock scenarios cover list and inspect output for all ten harnesses,
managed-service detection and the default endpoint fallback, dry-run and
approval behavior, safe config updates, rollback and `--no-check`, version
selection, protocol routes, precedence warnings, isolated harness probes, and
OMP's separate interactive default choice after registration.
Harness-binary coverage is deliberately narrower:

| Harnesses | Focused mock coverage | Real-binary coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code and Codex | Fake configuration, protocol, and CLI argv | One gated real-binary scenario |
| Hermes, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Aider, and Continue | Fake configuration, protocol, and CLI argv | None |
| Pi `0.84.4` and OMP `18.0.11` (major-18 gate) | Fake version acceptance and rejection, lossless availability setup and rollback, file safety, precedence warnings, Chat Completions, exact safe CLI argv, OMP registration-before-default prompting, noninteractive and dry-run default preservation, relative config-root and profile resolution, and legacy-registry refusal | None; fake binaries only |

The real Claude Code and Codex scenario uses a GPU-served vLLM model and is
excluded unless both opt-ins are set:

```bash
E2E_ONLY_AGENTS=1 E2E_INCLUDE_NIGHTLY=1 E2E_INCLUDE_REAL_AGENTS=1 cargo xtask e2e
```

It also requires Linux, a supported AMD GPU, an active managed runtime, vLLM,
and real `claude` and `codex` executables on `PATH`. The presence of this gated
scenario is not itself a coverage claim: count it as real-binary coverage only
for a lane that meets those prerequisites and actually runs it.

Pi and OMP remain fake-binary validation unless a qualifying opt-in real lane
actually exercises setup and the nonce probe; executable detection alone is
not real-binary coverage.

## TheRock SDK Install Test

The live SDK acceptance test creates an isolated test root under `target/`, creates a local bootstrap Python venv, runs:

```bash
rocm install sdk --channel release --format wheel
```

Then it verifies:

- runtime manifest metadata
- localized pip cache inside the selected ROCm runtime folder at
  `<install-root>/pip-cache`, including both generated managed folders and
  explicit `--prefix` folders
- the installer does not pre-create that pip cache during dry-run or setup;
  pip creates it inside the ROCm folder when packages are downloaded
- a single TheRock-index pip install plan for pinned `rocm[libraries,devel]`,
  `torch`, `torchvision`, and `torchaudio` versions
- package selection uses the newest exact ROCm build suffix common to the SDK
  package and the PyTorch stack for the current Python/platform wheel tags
- `python -m rocm_sdk version`
- `python -m rocm_sdk targets`
- runtime-only TheRock wheel discovery through
  `rocm_sdk.find_libraries("amdhip64", "hipblas")`
- vLLM adapter discovery of the managed TheRock runtime environment

Run the full live test with auto-detected GPU family:

```bash
python scripts/therock_sdk_install_test.py --root .rocm-work/tests/therock-sdk-install --fresh
```

Run only the resolver/harness path without downloading SDK wheels:

```bash
python scripts/therock_sdk_install_test.py --root .rocm-work/tests/therock-sdk-install --dry-run --check-windows-tools
```

Verify the first-time-setup style explicit folder path without downloading SDK
wheels:

```bash
python scripts/therock_sdk_install_test.py --root .rocm-work/tests/therock-sdk-install --dry-run --prefix .rocm-work/tests/rocm-folder
```

Use a deterministic family only for developer tests that need fixed package
selection:

```bash
python scripts/therock_sdk_install_test.py --root .rocm-work/tests/therock-sdk-install --fresh --family gfx120X-all
```

## ComfyUI TheRock GPU Acceptance

This opt-in test verifies that rocm-cli can install or reuse its managed
ComfyUI app, start it through the active TheRock ROCm runtime, reach the local
ComfyUI HTTP endpoint, report status/logs, and stop the launched process
without CPU fallback.

Run the offline harness self-test:

```bash
python scripts/comfyui_therock_gpu_test.py --self-test
```

Run the live test after first-time setup has installed and selected a managed
ROCm runtime:

```bash
python scripts/comfyui_therock_gpu_test.py
```

Run the live test with isolated rocm-cli state while reusing only the existing
managed TheRock runtime records:

```bash
python scripts/comfyui_therock_gpu_test.py --temp-state --copy-runtime-state-from %USERPROFILE%\.rocm
```

That command copies `config.json` and `runtimes/` into a temporary
`ROCM_CLI_CONFIG_DIR`, `ROCM_CLI_DATA_DIR`, and `ROCM_CLI_CACHE_DIR`, installs
ComfyUI in that temporary app state, then removes the temporary state after it
stops the process it started.

To reuse an already installed ComfyUI app without reinstalling dependencies:

```bash
python scripts/comfyui_therock_gpu_test.py --skip-install
```

To run a real image-generation smoke test, add `--generate-cat`. The harness
places a safetensors checkpoint in ComfyUI's checkpoint folder when needed,
submits a cat text-to-image workflow through the ComfyUI HTTP API, waits for
history completion, downloads the PNG, and rejects CPU-only device reports:

```bash
python scripts/comfyui_therock_gpu_test.py --generate-cat --output-dir .rocm-work/tests/comfyui-cat
```

The live test uses `rocm comfyui install`, `rocm comfyui start`, `rocm comfyui
status`, `rocm comfyui logs`, and `rocm comfyui stop`. It starts ComfyUI with
`--no-open-browser`, waits for `/system_stats`, verifies that
`rocm comfyui status` says `status: running`, and stops the process it started
unless `--keep-running` is set.

Manual non-TUI launch:

```bash
rocm comfyui install
rocm comfyui start
```

`rocm comfyui start` prints the local browser URL, normally
`http://127.0.0.1:8188`. It must also print `AMD GPU check: ready`; if that
check fails, rocm-cli stops instead of launching ComfyUI in CPU mode.

For WSL, run from the WSL filesystem instead of `/mnt`:

```bash
cd /home/$USER/rocm-cli-work/rocm-cli
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/home/$USER/rocm-cli-work/target-linux cargo build -p rocm
python3 scripts/comfyui_therock_gpu_test.py \
  --rocm /home/$USER/rocm-cli-work/target-linux/debug/rocm \
  --temp-state \
  --copy-runtime-state-from /home/$USER/.rocm \
  --generate-cat
```

## Runtime Selection And Activation

List registered managed or read-only runtimes and their exact side-by-side keys:

```bash
rocm runtimes list
```

Activate one validated runtime:

```bash
rocm runtimes activate <runtime_key>
```

Engine installs and managed serving inherit this active runtime by default.
If no runtime is active, pass `--runtime-id` explicitly or activate one first;
the CLI does not fall back to a built-in TheRock selector.

Normal user testing should switch versions by activating the exact runtime key
printed by `rocm runtimes list`. The TUI equivalent is `/runtimes`, then arrow
to an installed ROCm entry and press Enter.

Developer-only previous-runtime regression check:

```bash
rocm runtimes rollback
```

This command validates the saved previous-runtime marker, but it is not the
primary user-facing way to switch ROCm installs.

Import an existing rocm-cli/TheRock runtime manifest in read-only mode:

```bash
rocm runtimes import /path/to/.rocm-cli-runtime.json
```

Adopt an existing TheRock Python environment in read-only mode without writing
into that environment:

```bash
rocm runtimes adopt \
  --python /path/to/venv/bin/python \
  --root /path/to/venv \
  --runtime-id therock-release:gfx120X-all \
  --runtime-key adopted-release-pip-gfx120x-all-7-13-0
```

Focused unit coverage:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm runtime_activation
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm runtime_import
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm runtime_adopt
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm runtime_key_includes_version_for_side_by_side_installs
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm engine_plugin
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm missing_packaged_engine_reason
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm model_registry
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm render_model_registry_text_reports_host_ram_fit
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm model_recipe
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm logs
cargo test -p rocm-core model_recipe
cargo test -p rocm-core load_model_recipe_index
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm update_report_policy
cargo test -p rocm-engine-lemonade stdio_protocol_routes_all_methods_without_side_effects
cargo test -p rocm-engine-vllm stdio_protocol_routes_all_methods_without_side_effects
cargo test -p rocm-engine-vllm
cargo test -p rocmd event_collector
cargo test -p rocmd event_dispatcher
```

## Provider-Assisted Planning

The deterministic planner remains the default. Optional LLM/provider ambiguity
resolution is only used after a user configures a planner provider:

```bash
rocm config set-planner-provider local
rocm "start a local model"
```

For OpenAI or Anthropic, prompt sending must also be enabled and a key must be
available through the OS secure store or session environment:

```bash
rocm config set-planner-provider openai
rocm config enable-provider openai
rocm config set-provider-key openai
```

Provider-assisted output is reduced to a validated `rocm` tool call. It is
shown for review in the TUI, but non-interactive `rocm --yes ...` does not
execute provider-assisted plans automatically.

Focused coverage:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm provider_planner
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm freeform_execution_validation_rejects_provider_assisted_plans
```

Log browser smoke:

```bash
rocm logs
rocm logs --search server
rocm logs --service <service-id>
```

The no-log first-run path should report `no CLI logs found yet` without
creating the configured `data/logs` directory.

TUI log pagination focused tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm logs_browser
```

After opening `/logs` or `/logs --search <query>` in the TUI, use the arrow-key
menu instead of typing paging subcommands. `Left`/`Right` page the log browser,
`PageUp`/`PageDown` scroll the details, `R` refreshes, and the `Show file
locations` row reveals advanced paths only when needed.

Engine inventory smoke on native Windows:

```powershell
rocm engines list
```

The packaged Linux/WSL-only vLLM adapter should render
`runtime: unsupported_native_windows`, not `runtime: not found`.
The vLLM live GPU acceptance script should return a clean skip on native
Windows. It remains a strict GPU-required test on Linux/WSL.

Serve resolver focused tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm serve_engine_selection
```

These tests verify that explicit/configured engines still win and shared model
recipes only choose a preferred engine when no user/default engine is set.

Public-endpoint authentication focused tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm resolve_endpoint_auth
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm endpoint_client_config
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm api_key_client_config
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm public_bind_fails_closed
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm respawn_fails_closed
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm respawn_allows_loopback
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm restart_refuses_a_public_service
cargo test -p rocm-core generate_endpoint_api_key
cargo test -p rocm-engine-protocol endpoint_api_key
cargo test -p rocm-engine-protocol is_public_bind_host
cargo test -p rocmd recovery_respawn_fails_closed
cargo test -p rocmd apply_endpoint_key_env
```

A loopback bind (`rocm serve <model>`, default `127.0.0.1`) stays
credential-free. A public bind (`--host 0.0.0.0 --allow-public-bind`) requires an
API key: pass one with `--api-key` / the `ROCM_SERVE_API_KEY` environment
variable, or let one be generated. The key is handed to the engine via a 0600
key file (never argv), persisted as a 0600 per-service file (not the OS keychain,
which is unavailable on headless serving hosts), and printed once as client
configuration — it must never appear in `rocm services`, `rocm logs`, or the
audit log. Verifying that the running server actually *rejects* an
unauthenticated request requires a live engine; that end-to-end assertion is a
deferred follow-up and is **not yet** exercised by the GPU acceptance scripts
(`scripts/vllm_therock_gpu_test.py`). The unit tests cover key policy,
generation, the 0600 key file, and key-file resolution.

The same requirement holds across respawns, because the invariant belongs to the
recorded *host*, not to the key file: a service recorded on a public host refuses
to respawn once its key is gone, rather than coming back unauthenticated. That
covers `rocm services restart` and `rocmd`'s recovery supervisor, and the refusal
happens before anything is stopped, so it cannot take down a running service. A
stop therefore drops the key only once it has confirmed the engine is gone —
otherwise the CLI would lock itself out of a service that is still running and
still enforcing the key — and the deferred cleanup lands on the liveness refresh
that later observes the process dead. There is no e2e coverage of `services
stop`/`restart` or endpoint auth; these paths are unit-tested only.

Windows + Lemonade note: the Windows *managed* native-Lemonade server is launched
via `spawn_hidden_console_with_log`, whose env-override API is path-valued only,
so it cannot receive the value-typed `LEMONADE_API_KEY` that Lemonade's server
reads. Rather than launch an unauthenticated public server, `rocm serve` **fails
closed** on that exact combination (public bind + `--engine lemonade` + Windows)
and directs the user to `--engine vllm` or a loopback host. vLLM (all platforms,
via `VLLM_API_KEY`), the packaged llama-server fallback (via `--api-key-file`),
and Lemonade on non-Windows are all fully supported. Teaching the Windows
detached-spawn primitive to carry a value-typed override (so Windows Lemonade can
serve public with auth) is tracked as a separate follow-up.

Engine recipe adapter contract focused tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm-engine-protocol engine_recipe_hint_roundtrips_through_resolve_request
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm engine_recipe
cargo test -p rocm-engine-lemonade engine_recipe
cargo test -p rocm-engine-vllm engine_recipe
```

These tests verify that signed-index engine-specific recipe metadata is mapped
into the versioned engine protocol hint, and that each first-party adapter
accepts matching hints, rejects mismatched engine ids or contract versions, and
echoes accepted hints from `resolve_model`. First-party launch commands also
apply accepted engine recipe `required_flags`; mismatched hints are rejected
instead of being silently ignored.

Contained update-check automation tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocmd therock_update_contained_mode_runs_read_only_check_without_queueing
cargo test -p rocmd therock_update_contained_mode_records_update_available_without_applying
cargo test -p rocmd therock_update_contained_mode_uses_restricted_check_updates_tool
cargo test -p rocmd therock_update_notify_if_newer_uses_restricted_notification_contract
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_check_updates_value_is_read_only_and_preserves_output
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_check_updates_value_marks_runtime_update_available
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_driver_plan_value_is_read_only_and_preserves_output
cargo test -p rocmd watcher_policy_maps_modes_to_decisions
```

Manual Windows smoke:

```powershell
rocmd sandbox-run check_updates --allow-native-fallback
rocmd sandbox-run driver_plan --allow-native-fallback
```

The JSON output should include `mutating: false` and the captured
`rocm update` stdout for `check_updates`. Its `status` is `checked` when no
runtime update is reported, `update_available` when the read-only report
contains `status=update_available`, or `error` when the check fails.
Contained `therock-update` consumes the restricted `check_updates` tool result
and records a `notify_if_newer` notification/audit event only for the
`update_available` case, while still leaving proposal history empty.
`driver_plan` should include `status: planned`, `mutating: false`, and captured
`rocm install driver --dkms --dry-run` stdout. Neither tool must apply updates
or execute driver commands.

Restricted sandbox tool API tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_tool_cli_values_cover_restricted_plan_api
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_tool_examine_snapshot_is_read_only
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_tool_list_servers_returns_records
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_tool_list_servers_first_run_returns_empty_list
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_tool_requires_service_id_for_restart
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_tool_restart_server_reports_missing_service
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_tool_requires_service_id_for_stop
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_tool_stop_server_reports_missing_service
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_tool_stop_server_updates_manifest_and_skips_current_pid
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_tool_notify_user_is_read_only
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_runner_native_fallback_records_audit
```

These cover the plan-listed restricted internal tool API: `check_updates`,
`examine_snapshot`, `list_servers`, `restart_server`, `stop_server`,
`prefetch_artifact`, and `notify_user`, plus the plan-derived `driver_plan`
read-only extension. Read-only tools must report `mutating: false`;
`notify_user` must record a local notification audit event; server restart/stop
must require an explicit service id; sandbox-run native fallback or Linux
bubblewrap isolation must still execute only this internal tool API and record
a sandbox audit event.

Manual restricted-tool smoke:

```bash
rocmd sandbox-run examine_snapshot --allow-native-fallback
rocmd sandbox-run list_servers --allow-native-fallback
rocmd sandbox-run notify_user --message "ROCm check complete" --allow-native-fallback
```

On Linux/WSL with `bubblewrap` installed, these commands should report
`isolation: bubblewrap`; on native Windows they should report
`isolation: native_restricted`.

Direct MCP helper safety smoke:

```bash
cargo test -p rocmd direct_mcp_call -- --nocapture
cargo test -p rocmd rocm_mcp_tools -- --nocapture
rocmd mcp-call examine --arguments-json '{}'
rocmd mcp-call install_sdk --arguments-json '{}'
```

The read-only `examine` helper call should run. The `install_sdk` helper call
must fail unless `--allow-mutation` is supplied after an explicit user
approval. User-facing TUI/chat flows should still route mutating tool calls
through their normal approval cards rather than relying on this hidden helper
flag.

Artifact cache and prefetch policy tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm-core model_artifact_cache
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm model_recipe_artifact_lines_surface_signed_index_metadata
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_downloads_direct_artifact_when_approved
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_blocks_approved_artifact_without_sha256
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_blocks_artifact_larger_than_approved_limit
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_cached_marker_skips_network
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_blocks_non_direct_non_huggingface_source
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_unknown_artifact_ref_errors
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_reports_policy_required_without_network
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_blocks_gated_huggingface_without_source_policy
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_blocks_huggingface_source_policy_without_token
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_respects_manual_only_source_policy
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_respects_declared_huggingface_auth_policy
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_never_sends_huggingface_token_to_non_huggingface_url
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_never_sends_huggingface_token_over_plain_http
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_prefetch_requires_artifact_ref
```

`prefetch_artifact` is no-network by default. Without approval it should report
`source_policy_required`, `mutating: false`, and `network_used: false`.
Approved live prefetch uses:

```bash
rocmd sandbox-run prefetch_artifact \
  --artifact-ref <model-ref>#<artifact-id> \
  --allow-artifact-download \
  --artifact-max-bytes <bytes> \
  --allow-native-fallback
```

The approved path supports direct HTTP(S) artifact URIs that include
`size_bytes` and `sha256` recipe metadata. It downloads the bytes, enforces the
byte limit, verifies sha256, writes an atomic cache marker, and reports
`status: prefetched`. Gated artifacts, missing hashes, and non-direct sources
remain blocked instead of falling back to an unverified download unless a
source-specific policy explicitly applies.

Signed recipe artifacts can also declare `source_policy` metadata. The
signed-index loader validates policy names, host constraints, HTTPS
requirements, and required integrity metadata. `/model` shows the policy, and
`prefetch_artifact` enforces `manual_only` and authenticated Hugging Face
requirements even after a generic artifact download approval.

For gated Hugging Face artifacts, the approved path also requires
`--allow-huggingface-download` plus `ROCM_CLI_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`, `HF_TOKEN`,
or `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN`. rocm-cli should still refuse to send that token to
anything other than an HTTPS Hugging Face URL, and tokens must not appear in
JSON output. On Windows, pass `--allow-native-fallback` when manually running
`rocmd sandbox-run` because bubblewrap isolation is Linux-only.

Driver reconciliation focused tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm driver_plan_ -- --nocapture
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm driver_reconcile_updates_state_after_reboot
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm driver_passive_check_summary_counts_non_present_as_missing
```

The driver-plan tests are non-privileged. They verify AMD-documented
package-manager plans for Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, Oracle Linux, Rocky, and SLES,
while unsupported Linux IDs remain non-mutating instead of guessed. The
reconcile path is also non-privileged. It refreshes passive checks and persists
the `total`/`present`/`missing` check summary without running DKMS commands.

Provider audit focused test:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm local_provider_stream_chat_posts_sse_request
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm remote_openai_stream_chat_uses_live_sse
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm remote_anthropic_stream_chat_uses_live_sse
```

This verifies the streamed local provider path writes a `provider` audit event
with action `stream_chat` after the SSE stream completes. The remote provider
tests use local HTTP fixtures to prove OpenAI and Anthropic send `stream: true`
requests and deliver the first SSE delta to the callback before the server
closes the connection.

Proposal history rendering:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm render_automations_text_uses_plain_proposal_history
```

The plain proposal history test verifies that `/automations` and
`rocm automations` show recent review requests with friendly action, reason,
server/artifact details, and approve/reject controls instead of raw backend
action or restricted-tool names.

Natural-language plan handoff tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm hybrid_planner_normalizes_model_alias_and_structured_serve_call
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm freeform_plan_next_action_surfaces_approval_action
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm freeform_invocation_supports_leading_yes_for_natural_language_only

cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm natural_serve_with_missing_model_does_not_focus_approval
```

In the TUI, recognized mutating plain-language requests render a plan and then
focus the normal approval card. Missing placeholders remain plan-only.
Outside the TUI, `rocm --yes <natural language request>` renders the same plan
and executes only the final structured `rocm` tool call after placeholder
validation. Requests beginning with flags or unquoted structured command names
are rejected; quote the natural-language request or phrase it as natural
language, and run structured commands directly with their own approval flag
when they define one.

Cloud provider opt-in tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm-core provider_config_defaults_to_local_only
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm provider
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm render_config_text_includes_telemetry_policy
```

OpenAI and Anthropic prompt sending must fail before env-key lookup or network
access until the provider is explicitly enabled with `rocm config
enable-provider <provider>`.

Cloud API keys are stored outside `config.json`:

```bash
printf '%s' "$OPENAI_API_KEY" | rocm config set-provider-key openai
rocm config enable-provider openai
rocm config show
rocm config clear-provider-key openai
```

`rocm config show` should report whether the key is saved in the OS secure
store, missing, or coming from `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the
current session. It must never print the key. Remote provider HTTP requests are
sent in-process so API keys are not passed through `curl` command arguments.
In the TUI, clearing a saved API key defaults to `Cancel`; users must move the
highlight to `Clear API key` before Enter removes anything.

Update-surface report test:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm render_update_text_reports_all_update_surfaces
```

`rocm update` must report runtime checks plus CLI, engine, and model-recipe
surfaces honestly. `rocm update --apply` remains runtime-only until production
metadata feeds exist for the other surfaces.

Model recipe engine metadata checks:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm-core model_recipe_index
cargo test -p rocm-core model_recipe_index_signature_accepts_generated_key_and_rejects_tamper
cargo test -p rocm model_recipe_artifact_lines_surface_signed_index_metadata
cargo test -p rocm render_freeform_plan_exposes_structured_tool_calls
```

Engine-specific recipe metadata uses a versioned adapter/protocol hint for
`resolve_model` and launch. `/model` and `rocm serve` should show selected
engine recipe metadata clearly. First-party adapters must apply accepted
launch-time `required_flags`, reject mismatched engine ids or contract
versions, and fail loudly for unsupported flags instead of silently ignoring
them.

Release trust checks:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm --bin rocm metadata_signature_verification_accepts_generated_key_and_rejects_tamper
cargo test -p rocm-core model_recipe_index_signature_accepts_generated_key_and_rejects_tamper
python scripts/release_readiness.py --self-test
ROCDXG_CHECKSUM_SELF_TEST=1 bash scripts/wsl_setup_rocdxg.sh
bash scripts/setup-wsl-portable-build-deps.sh --self-test
```

The release-readiness self-test is cross-platform and uses only workspace-local
temporary files under `.rocm-work/tests/release-readiness`. It also checks exact
release asset sets, so stale archives and orphan checksum/signature sidecars in
`dist` fail before upload, and it validates both missing and explicitly
configured production trust inputs. Normal Linux and Windows CI run this
self-test before the install-lifecycle E2E scenarios.

### Packaging

`cargo xtask package <dist-name> [output-dir] [--target <triple>]` builds the
release distribution bundle in pure Rust — a `.tar.gz` on Unix and a `.zip` on
Windows — with a `sha256` sidecar and, when a signing key is configured, a
detached `.sig`. It replaces the former `scripts/package-{linux,windows}-release`
scripts and produces the same external artifact contract (bundle layout,
checksum syntax, signature presence, and installer compatibility). Signing
inputs come from the environment for parity with those scripts:
`ROCM_CLI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` (a PEM file) or
`ROCM_CLI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM` (an inline PEM); set
`ROCM_CLI_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE=1` to fail unless a signature is produced.

### Install lifecycle (opt-in `@lifecycle` E2E)

The full install lifecycle — packaging, signature-verified install, tamper
rejection, reinstall, PATH handling, and uninstall — is expressed as
`@lifecycle` scenarios in the [E2E cucumber suite](../tests/e2e-cucumber/README.md)
(`features/install_lifecycle.feature`). They drive `cargo xtask package`, the
real root installer (`install.sh` / `install.ps1`), and the installed binaries
end to end, replacing the former
`scripts/acceptance-install-upgrade-tui-uninstall.{sh,ps1}` scripts and
preserving the union of their assertions.

These scenarios are expensive and OS-mutating, so they are **skipped by
default** to keep `cargo xtask e2e` fast. Run only the lifecycle scenarios for
the current host by opting in and selecting that set through the harness:

```bash
E2E_INCLUDE_LIFECYCLE=1 E2E_ONLY_LIFECYCLE=1 cargo xtask e2e
```

The harness applies the matching OS requirement itself; do not select these
with cucumber's `--tags`/`-n` flags, because those bypass the suite's custom
expectation and applicability resolver.

Heavy CI runs the matching set per platform. The scenarios reject untrusted
signers, bad checksums, bad detached signatures, and missing required signature
sidecars before activation; cover generated private-key PEM packaging and
generated public-key PEM installer verification; verify first-install PATH setup
(Windows persists the install folder to the user PATH and restores it afterward;
Linux writes the shell profile); reinstall stale-manifest purge and config
preservation; a Windows loopback-HTTP install; isolated installed-binary
directory smoke checks (`rocm examine` must read only the isolated
config/data/cache, never the real user `.rocm` state); and full-purge uninstall.
Each scenario generates its own local keys, package, and install root under a
per-scenario temp directory, so they are independent and use generated local
keys only — project-owned production signing keys remain an owner-controlled
release step.

If the host does not have `libcap-dev` or `libssl-dev`, run
`bash scripts/setup-wsl-portable-build-deps.sh` first: it downloads the Ubuntu
development packages into `.rocm-work/tools/wsl-build-deps`, extracts only the
headers, libraries, and pkg-config metadata there, and points
`PKG_CONFIG_PATH`/`PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` at that local copy — no sudo required.
Run `bash scripts/setup-wsl-portable-build-deps.sh --self-test` to verify the
portable sysroot normalization path without apt, network access, or a real WSL
package download.

Automation endpoint-health event tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocmd event_collector
cargo test -p rocmd event_collector_emits_endpoint_recoverable_service_event
cargo test -p rocmd server_recover_local_webhook_does_not_restart_healthy_service
cargo test -p rocmd recovery_reason_display_avoids_raw_status_tokens
```

Automation GPU-metrics event tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocmd gpu_metrics
cargo test -p rocmd event_collector_emits_gpu_metrics_event_when_enabled
```

The `gpu-metrics` watcher is read-only in all modes. It records bounded local
`amd-smi` telemetry availability or unavailability and must not queue proposals
or take thermal/serving actions until a policy is explicitly defined.

Automation cache-warm event tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocmd local_webhook_cache_warm_builds_prefetch_event
cargo test -p rocmd local_webhook_cache_warm_rejects_other_cache_events
cargo test -p rocmd cache_warm_propose_mode_queues_prefetch_proposal
cargo test -p rocmd cache_warm_unknown_artifact_does_not_queue_proposal
cargo test -p rocmd cache_warm_contained_mode_still_requires_reviewed_source_policy
```

The `cache-warm` watcher accepts exactly `cache.warm`, requires
`payload.artifact_ref`, verifies that the ref exists in the model recipe
registry before queueing, queues a reviewed `prefetch_artifact` proposal, and
does not grant webhook payloads arbitrary tool choice or automatic download
permission. The TUI can add reviewed source-policy fields with
`/automations edit <id> allow-download yes` and
`/automations edit <id> artifact-max-bytes <bytes>`; approved downloads require
that byte limit.

Automation driver-upgrade event tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocmd local_webhook_driver_upgrade
cargo test -p rocmd driver_upgrade
cargo test -p rocmd driver_upgrade_contained_mode_runs_restricted_driver_plan
cargo test -p rocmd driver_upgrade_contained_mode_requires_restricted_driver_plan_tool
cargo test -p rocmd sandbox_driver_plan_value_is_read_only_and_preserves_output
cargo test -p rocm-core builtin_watchers_include_reviewed_driver_upgrade
```

The `driver-upgrade` watcher accepts exactly `update.available` with
`payload.component=driver`. In `propose` mode it queues a reviewed
`driver_plan` proposal. In `contained` mode it consumes the restricted
`driver_plan` tool result directly. Both paths stay read-only; the user-facing
approval should say it shows the driver plan only and that no driver will be
installed.

Automation local-webhook source tests:

```bash
cargo test -p rocmd local_webhook
cargo test -p rocmd local_webhook_therock_update_accepts_exact_schedule_tick_only
cargo test -p rocmd local_webhook_server_recover_rejects_nonrecoverable_service_kind
cargo test -p rocmd local_webhook_gpu_metrics_rejects_thermal_action_kinds
cargo test -p rocm render_automations_text_surfaces_local_webhook_endpoint
```

The local webhook source is loopback-only. It is enabled only with
`rocmd run --automations-enabled --local-webhook-port <port>`, accepts JSON
`POST /automation-events`, validates `watcher_hint` and `kind` against the
exact event kinds accepted by that watcher, and then dispatches through the
same watcher policy paths as scheduler, managed-service recovery, GPU
telemetry, and cache-warm proposal events. See `docs/automations.md` for the
local curl smoke and accepted fields.

vLLM TheRock GPU acceptance:

```bash
cargo test -p rocm-engine-vllm running_state_records_managed_therock_env_for_gpu_verification
cargo test -p rocm-engine-vllm managed_env_reflects_managed_runtime_manifest_source
cargo test -p rocm-engine-vllm resolve_model_omits_gpu_memory_utilization_default
python -m py_compile scripts/vllm_therock_gpu_test.py
python scripts/vllm_therock_gpu_test.py --self-test

# On Linux/WSL with vLLM installed in the active rocm-cli managed TheRock venv:
python3 scripts/vllm_therock_gpu_test.py \
  --engine /home/user/.cache/rocm-cli-target/debug/rocm-engine-vllm \
  --model facebook/opt-125m
```

The script defaults to the active exact runtime key. If `--runtime-id` is used,
it must be an exact runtime key or an unambiguous runtime id. It requires
`gpu_required`, rejects external vLLM command overrides, checks `/health` and
`/v1/completions`, and verifies loaded ROCm libraries came from the managed
TheRock SDK wheel directories.
For TheRock 7.13, patch vLLM's GPTQ ROCm compatibility guard to include HIP
7.13 before building from source; otherwise `q_gemm.hip` can fail on missing
`half`/`half2` `atomicAdd` overloads.
On native Windows this script prints a JSON skip result; run it from WSL/Linux
for live ROCm GPU acceptance.

## Windows Tool Notes

The TheRock SDK wheel install path should not require users to install global
Python or curl. rocm-cli uses Rust-native HTTP downloads and can bootstrap a
managed Python under its data directory when no usable Python is available.

TheRock's Windows source-build guide documents `winget` and manual installs for
MSVC, Git, CMake, Ninja, Python, Strawberry Perl, DVC, and related tools. The
SDK install test reports these when `--check-windows-tools` is set, but normal
SDK wheel setup should avoid global source-build tools.

## WSL Preflight

Read-only WSL/ROCDXG preflight:

```bash
python scripts/wsl_preflight.py --json
python scripts/wsl_preflight.py --require-ready
```

`--require-ready` checks WSL, `/dev/dxg`, DXCore, ROCDXG, `python3 -m venv`,
and library registration. Source-build tools such as Windows SDK headers,
CMake, and compilers are optional for runtime acceptance; add
`--require-build-tools` only when validating a WSL source-build environment.

Interactive ROCDXG install inside WSL:

```bash
bash scripts/wsl_setup_rocdxg.sh
python scripts/wsl_preflight.py --require-ready
```

To require checksum verification for the downloaded ROCDXG `.deb`, provide the
expected package digest from a trusted release source:

```bash
ROCDXG_SHA256=<64-hex-sha256> bash scripts/wsl_setup_rocdxg.sh
```
