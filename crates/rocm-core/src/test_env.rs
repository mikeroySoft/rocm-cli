//! Restoring a process environment variable for the duration of a test.
//!
//! A test that replaces a variable, calls into the code under test, and then
//! puts the old value back in straight-line code leaks that variable if
//! anything in between panics. The `*_TEST_LOCK` mutexes these tests take are
//! acquired with [`std::sync::PoisonError::into_inner`], deliberately, so a
//! poisoned lock does not cascade into every later test — which means the leak
//! is not contained either: the next test to take the lock reads the value the
//! panicking one planted, usually pointing at a temporary directory that has
//! since been deleted.
//!
//! [`RestoredEnvVar`] moves the restore into `Drop`, where unwinding runs it.

/// This RESTORES; it does not SERIALIZE. Two tests holding one of these for the

///
/// The env-mutation contract guard in `xtask` enforces that, but only because
/// `RestoredEnvVar::set(` is named in its `MUTATIONS` list. The guard matches
/// call TEXT, so wrapping a mutation in a method hides it by default — a
/// restoring helper added later is outside the guard until it is listed too.
