//! Guard `docs/architecture.md`'s path citations against silent drift.
//!
//! The doc tells contributors "verify current file and function boundaries
//! directly ... rather than trusting this doc's wording" — that disclaimer
//! exists because nothing previously checked that the paths it cites still
//! exist. A renamed or removed file then rots silently in the doc until a
//! reader notices. This check makes the doc self-policing instead: it
//! extracts every backtick-quoted path citation and fails, naming every one
//! not found where it's cited. Exactly where a given citation is checked
//! depends on its shape (a slash path, a bare filename, a bare directory
//! name) — see [`citation_exists`]'s doc comment for the one, canonical
//! statement of that rule; nowhere else in this module, `main.rs`,
//! `ci.yml`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or `docs/architecture.md` restates it, so
//! there is exactly one place for it to drift out of sync with the code.
//!
//! Same shape as [`crate::crate_edges`]: a reusable [`run`] plus
//! `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests on the pure extraction/lookup helpers, and one
//! test asserting the real doc passes today.
//!
//! ## Telling a path citation from a code snippet
//!
//! The doc is prose, not a code listing, but it still backtick-quotes
//! plenty of non-path Rust syntax alongside real paths: `` `crate::` ``,
//! `` `pub(crate) fn` ``, `` `comfyui::render_status(...)` ``,
//! `` `too_many_lines = "allow"` ``, and bare type names like
//! `` `ActionReport` ``. [`is_path_candidate`] filters those out; see its
//! doc comment for the exact rule and its known blind spots: a bare,
//! non-hyphenated word like `` `xtask` `` is indistinguishable from a plain
//! English word like `` `grep` ``, and a bare filename whose extension
//! isn't in [`BARE_FILE_EXTENSIONS`] (e.g. `` `report.json` ``) isn't
//! recognized as a citation shape at all — both are deliberately never
//! checked, so they go unchecked rather than risk false-flagging prose or
//! an arbitrary extension.
//!
//! ## Scoping bare filename citations to their section
//!
//! The doc cites `` `main.rs` ``/`` `lib.rs` `` bare, by design, under
//! several different `### \`<crate>\`` headings — one per subsystem still
//! pending modularization. The workspace has ~17 files literally named
//! `main.rs` or `lib.rs`, so checking a bare citation against "exists
//! anywhere in the repo" would make the check nearly a no-op for exactly
//! the citations it most needs to catch: renaming *`apps/rocmd`'s* `lib.rs`
//! would go undetected as long as some unrelated crate's `lib.rs` still
//! exists. [`extract_path_citations`] records each citation's nearest
//! preceding heading's directories, and [`citation_exists`] uses that
//! context to check "does this specific section's file still exist"
//! instead — see both functions' doc comments for the exact rule and its
//! (narrower, documented) fallback.
