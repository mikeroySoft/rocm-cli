//! Pick which runtime a scenario should activate out of a shared pre-warm tree.
//!
//! Scenarios that only need *a* runtime present point their `data/runtimes` at a
//! shared, install-once tree (see `E2eWorld::use_shared_runtimes`). Serving out of
//! that tree used to need no further wiring: the CLI auto-selects a runtime when
//! exactly one is installed, and the tree held exactly one.
//!
//! That stopped being true once the pre-warm started adopting a newer runtime
//! side by side with the old one. The CLI's auto-selection is deliberately
//! all-or-nothing — with two installed it refuses to guess and serve fails with
//! "no active ROCm runtime is configured" — so a tree holding more than one
//! silently broke every GPU serve scenario. The count is not something the suite
//! controls: it follows whatever the upstream channel index has published.
//!
//! So the scenario names its runtime explicitly instead of relying on the count.
//! The pre-warm activates the runtime it installed and the CLI records that in
//! `<runtimes>/active.json`, which lives *inside* the shared tree and is therefore
//! visible through the symlink even though each scenario keeps its own config dir.
//! Reading it back is what makes selection deterministic for any tree contents.
//!
//! Naming a runtime is not the same as naming a *usable* one, which is the second
//! half of this. A registry entry can outlive the folder it points at, and a name
//! the CLI rejects fails the scenario just as surely as no name at all — so what
//! gets named is filtered down to the entries `activate` can accept.
