//! Drift guard for the shape of `skills/rocm-doctor/reference.md`'s catalog.
//!
//! The `rocm_doctor_skill.feature` scenarios compare that table against the
//! real `rocm fix` listing, cell for cell, so a cell the table spells its own
//! way is a contract failure. Those scenarios need a built `rocm` binary and
//! only run under `cargo xtask e2e`; this file runs in the ordinary `cargo
//! test` set, so the malformed cell is caught without one.
//!
//! Narrow on purpose: the CLI is authoritative for *which* fixes exist and what
//! they are scoped to, and the feature file already checks that. All this
//! checks is that the document uses the vocabulary the CLI prints, so the
//! comparison there can stay a literal one.
