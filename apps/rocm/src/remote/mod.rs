//! Driving a remote GPU host from this machine.
//!
//! The split this module is built around: **SSH is the control channel, not the
//! data path.** Everything that inspects or changes the remote — probing it,
//! starting a managed `rocm serve`, reading the service registry, tearing a
//! session down — goes over SSH via [`transport`]. The inference traffic does
//! not: the remote publishes its own loopback-bound service onto the tailnet
//! (see [`publish`]), so there is no local tunnel process and no local port to
//! keep alive. An endpoint therefore outlives the command that created it and
//! answers from any of the user's machines, not only this one.
//!
//! Two lifecycles, both on the remote and both able to fail alone: the model
//! server, and the publish pointing at it. `status` reports them as separate
//! facts rather than one health value, because the repair differs — a withdrawn
//! publish is re-declared, a dead server has to be started again.
//!
//! Keeping the control channel narrow is what makes this testable: it is one
//! trait with a scripted stand-in, and [`tailnet`]/[`publish`] parsing is pure,
//! so the flows below are unit tests with no network, no SSH server, and no
//! tailnet.
