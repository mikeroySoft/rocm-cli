# A stand-in for Tailscale on the test remote, covering `serve` and `funnel`.
#
# It keeps its forwards in a file shaped like the real ServeConfig, so publish,
# inspect and withdraw are genuinely stateful: withdrawing has to actually
# remove the entry for a test to see it gone. That is the property worth
# checking here — a publish outlives reboots, so a withdrawal that silently does
# nothing leaves an endpoint exposed with nothing tracking it.
#
# `funnel` exists here only as a way to put the remote into the state the CLI
# must refuse to publish over. The CLI never runs it — it reads `AllowFunnel`
# out of the serve config and bails — but without a fake that can *write* that
# key, the classifier's exposure branch is only ever exercised against
# hand-written fixtures, never against something daemon-shaped.
