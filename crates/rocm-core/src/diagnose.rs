//! Rust port of the `rocm-doctor` skill's `diagnose.py`. It matches an
//! [`Examination`] (plus optional user symptom text) against a **closed list**
//! of known misconfigurations and returns ranked [`Diagnosis`] results, each
//! with the evidence it used and a [`Fix`] (plan + verify step). When nothing
