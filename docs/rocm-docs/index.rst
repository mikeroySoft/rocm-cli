ROCm CLI is a command-line tool for setting up and running local AI on AMD
GPUs, with a full-screen TUI dashboard for GPU telemetry, model serving, and
chat.

It ships as a single prebuilt binary for Linux and Windows (x86_64), needs no
Python, Rust, or existing ROCm install, and includes inference engine
adapters for Lemonade and vLLM.
