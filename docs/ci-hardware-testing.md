# CI hardware (GPU / WSL) testing

The hosted CI (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`) builds and unit-tests every
shipping target natively, but GitHub-hosted runners have no AMD GPU. A
dedicated hardware layer covers that gap by running the same cucumber-rs E2E
suite on dedicated self-hosted runners with real AMD GPUs.

That hardware layer lives in its **own workflow**, `.github/workflows/e2e-selfhosted.yml`,
separate from the main `ci.yml`. The split is deliberate: a job queued on an
**offline** self-hosted runner cannot be cancelled by GitHub, so if it shared
`ci.yml`'s concurrency group a superseded run would hold that group and the
newer run's merge-required (GitHub-hosted) checks would sit pending forever
(observed on PR #138). Giving the self-hosted lanes their own workflow — and
thus their own concurrency group — means an offline runner can only ever stall
that workflow's own supersession, never `ci.yml`'s required checks. See
`EAI-7548`.

## Platforms

The E2E suite (BDD scenarios in Gherkin `.feature` files backed by Rust step
functions) runs as one job per platform. Each job's harness resolves every
scenario to pass / xfail / skip for that host from its `@id` and
`@requires-*` tags, a capability probe, and `expectations.toml` — there is no
separate tier flag or tag filter to maintain.

| Job | Workflow | Platform | Runner labels |
|---|---|---|---|
| `e2e` | `ci.yml` | Mock (no GPU) | GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` |
| `e2e-gpu` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | MI300X (AMD Instinct, bare-metal Linux) | self-hosted `[self-hosted, linux, mi300x]` |
| `e2e-gpu-strix-ubuntu` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | Strix Halo (gfx1151) on Ubuntu | self-hosted `[self-hosted, linux, devlab-dispatch, strix-halo]` |
| `e2e-gpu-strix-windows` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | Strix Halo (gfx1151) on Windows 11 | self-hosted `[self-hosted, windows, devlab-dispatch, strix-halo]` |
| `e2e-wsl` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | Strix Halo (gfx1151) on Ubuntu under WSL2 | self-hosted `[self-hosted, linux, strix-halo, wsl]` |
| `e2e-gpu-rad3` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | Radeon AI PRO R9700 (gfx1201) on Linux | self-hosted `[self-hosted, linux, r9700]` |
| `e2e-gpu-mi350p` | `e2e-selfhosted.yml` | MI350P (AMD Instinct, gfx950) on Linux | self-hosted `[self-hosted, linux, mi350p]` |

The Ubuntu and Windows Strix Halo lanes run on the AMD Ryzen DevLab Dispatch
pool: a fresh runner is registered per job and destroyed after, opt-in only via
the `devlab-dispatch` label, so the pool never picks up a job by accident even
though its hosts also carry `strix-halo`. `e2e-wsl` stays on a static, always-on
host (a WSL2 guest on a specific pre-configured Windows box, not generic Strix
Halo hardware — the pool doesn't provide an equivalent) and pins the extra
`wsl` label to disambiguate it from any other Linux Strix Halo runner.

This migration is scoped to the per-PR lanes in this table only.
`nightly.yml`'s Ubuntu and Windows Strix lanes (`e2e-gpu-nightly-strix`,
`e2e-gpu-nightly-strix-windows`) still pin the `native` label and run on the
same static, always-on host these per-PR lanes moved off of — that label still
means what it always did there (two Linux runners share `strix-halo`, a native
host and a WSL host, and `native` disambiguates the former). Moving nightly
onto the pool is a separate, not-yet-made decision.

Every label in a `runs-on` must narrow the pool to one kind of hardware. In
particular the MI300X lane pins `mi300x` rather than `amd-gpu`: `amd-gpu` is
carried by every AMD GPU runner, Strix Halo included, so it selects a
mixed-silicon pool. `every_self_hosted_lane_pins_a_hardware_label` in
`xtask/src/workflow_contract.rs` enforces this, because the failure is quiet —
the lane simply passes on the wrong GPU and reports under the label it was
named for.

`e2e` is the blocking, GitHub-hosted mock job: `@requires-gpu` scenarios
resolve to skip here, and known bugs resolve to xfail from
`expectations.toml`. It is a required check and must stay green.

The self-hosted jobs (`e2e-gpu`, `e2e-gpu-strix-ubuntu`, `e2e-gpu-strix-windows`,
`e2e-wsl`, `e2e-gpu-rad3`, and `e2e-gpu-mi350p`) run on AMD GPU systems, so they
exercise host/GPU detection, engine `detect`/`capabilities`, and live serving
scenarios that the mock job cannot. GPU availability is advisory in the WSL lane, as
described below.

`e2e-wsl` runs on an Ubuntu distro hosted in WSL2 on the Strix Halo Windows box
and mirrors the sibling Linux lane step for step: stray-serve reclaim, GPU
preflight, toolchain bootstrap, shared-runtime pre-warm, then the full suite
with no hand filtering. It covers WSL host detection, the Windows-to-WSL
execution boundary, and whatever GPU access WSL exposes on that machine. The
GPU preflight is advisory here precisely because GPU-on-WSL is what the lane is
proving out: where it is unavailable the capability probe resolves those
scenarios to not-applicable and the rest of the suite still runs. Scenarios the
product deliberately routes around on WSL carry `@requires-bare-metal`;
scenarios whose premise *is* a WSL host carry `@requires-wsl`, and this is the
only lane that runs them.

`rocm diagnose` is no longer one of the things routed around: it carries a WSL
catalog of its own, so the `@requires-wsl` diagnose scenarios — that a WSL host
is never given a bare-metal cause, and that a WSL remedy is explained rather
than carried out — are proven here and nowhere else.

### What the WSL distro needs

The distro needs `pkg-config`, `build-essential` and `libcap-dev` to build the
workspace; the lane installs them itself where it has passwordless sudo, and
otherwise fails with the list of what is missing rather than hanging on a
password prompt.

GPU coverage additionally needs ROCm's WSL passthrough to be complete —
`/dev/dxg` and dxcore alone are not enough, `librocdxg.so` and its ldconfig
entry must be present too. `rocm examine` reports the verdict as
`driver_status: wsl_rocdxg_ready`; anything else (`wsl_rocdxg_missing`,
`wsl_gpu_plumbing_missing`) means the runtime cannot reach the device even
though `detected_gfx_target` still names it, because that target is read from
the Windows-side driver. The capability probe keys `@requires-gpu` on the
driver verdict rather than the target for exactly this reason, so a distro
without the passthrough runs the non-GPU suite and reports the GPU scenarios as
not applicable, instead of failing them on a premise the host cannot meet.

Each workflow has its own consolidated report job. `ci.yml`'s `e2e-report`
covers the mock platform;
`e2e-selfhosted.yml`'s `e2e-report` covers the GPU platforms;
`nightly.yml`'s `e2e-report-nightly` covers the same platforms with the
`@nightly` scenarios included. Each joins its platforms'
reports — including partial or failed runs — by scenario id into one HTML report
and GitHub step summary.

The lane artifacts are named canonically (`e2e-report`, `e2e-gpu-report`,
`e2e-gpu-rad3-report`, `e2e-gpu-mi350p-report`, `e2e-gpu-strix-ubuntu-report`,
`e2e-gpu-strix-windows-report`, `e2e-gpu-strix-wsl-report`) in every workflow,
because the report derives each platform's name and OS from the artifact name.
An unrecognised name renders as a guessed platform on Linux, which would report
a Windows lane as Linux; `xtask`'s
`every_uploaded_e2e_artifact_has_a_name_the_report_can_label` guards against it.

## Triggers

The GPU jobs (in `e2e-selfhosted.yml`) run automatically on `push`,
`pull_request`, and `merge_group` when the workflow's own `changes` job's
`serve` path filter is `true`. `serve` is narrower than `heavy`: it matches only
paths that can change serve *behaviour* or the GPU E2E harness (the engines, the
serve code path in `apps/rocm`/`apps/rocmd`, `rocm-core`, the e2e-cucumber crate,
plus broad-dependency safety nets), **not** a blanket `**/*.rs`. So a Rust change
that cannot affect serving — e.g. a dashboard-only or unrelated-crate PR — skips
the heavy GPU matrix, while compile coverage for every crate still runs on
`ci.yml`'s always-on build/test lanes. Off `pull_request` (push/merge_group) the
filter is forced `true`, so the full matrix always runs there. Unlike the
pre-split layout the GPU jobs do **not** gate on the hosted `build-and-test` job
— cross-workflow `needs` is not possible, so each GPU job builds the `rocm`
binary itself as its first real step (a broken build fails that job fast and
non-fatally). `ci.yml`'s required `build-and-test` and mock `e2e` remain the
authoritative pre-merge build gate.

They can also be triggered manually via `e2e-selfhosted.yml`'s
`workflow_dispatch`, independent of the `serve` gate, with these inputs:

- `platform` (choice: `all`, `app-dev-gpu`, `strix-ubuntu`, `strix-windows`,
  `strix-wsl`, `rad3`, `mi350p`) — which self-hosted job(s) to run. `app-dev-gpu`
  maps to `e2e-gpu`, `strix-ubuntu` to `e2e-gpu-strix-ubuntu`, `strix-windows` to
  `e2e-gpu-strix-windows`, `strix-wsl` to `e2e-wsl`, `rad3` to
  `e2e-gpu-rad3`, and `mi350p` to `e2e-gpu-mi350p`. (The mock lane has its own
  `platform` input on `ci.yml`; it is not part of this workflow.)
- `name_filter` (string) — a scenario-name regex forwarded to the cucumber
  harness (`cargo xtask e2e -- --name <regex>`) so a dispatch can run a
  single scenario instead of the full suite. Empty runs everything applicable
  to the selected platform(s).
- `include_nightly` (boolean, default `false`) — opts a dispatch into
  `@nightly`-tagged scenarios (e.g. large-model serves, cold installs) that
  are otherwise skipped on a normal push/PR run to keep it fast.

Dispatch the GPU lanes with, e.g.:

```bash
gh workflow run e2e-selfhosted.yml --ref <ref> -f platform=app-dev-gpu
```

## The shared pre-warmed runtime

Nearly every GPU serve scenario points its `data/runtimes` at one shared,
pre-warmed managed runtime tree (`E2E_SHARED_RUNTIMES_DIR`), so a multi-GiB
`rocm install sdk` happens once per runner instead of once per scenario. The tree
lives on the runner's persistent workspace, survives `git clean`, and is namespaced
by source-layout generation (`e2e-prewarm-multi-arch-v2`) so a branch using a new
package layout cannot poison the cache consumed by code that only understands the
previous layout.

The tree may hold **more than one** runtime — the pre-warm installs a newer one
side by side when the channel index publishes it (below) — so scenarios must not
rely on the CLI auto-selecting a runtime, which it deliberately declines to do
once two are installed. Each scenario keeps its own config dir, so the pre-warm's
`--activate` is invisible to it; the precondition steps re-activate from the
tree's own `active.json`, which lives inside the shared tree and is therefore
visible through the symlink. Without that, a serve fails with `no active ROCm
runtime is configured` while the precondition still passes.

It is a **cache with invalidation and repair**, not a one-shot install. Each
self-hosted lane calls:

```bash
cargo xtask e2e-prewarm --channel release --prewarm-dir "$prewarm"
```

before the suite. `rocm update` compares both the channel version and the wheel
composition recorded in the runtime manifest (source-layout generation and exact
pinned package specs, including the `device-<target>` payload). A deterministic
composition fingerprint is part of each wheel runtime key, so a corrected
composition is installed beside — never over — the old environment. Each report
line also carries `target=<key>`: the runtime key an apply from that line would
produce, which on a superseded manifest is its already-installed replacement.
Pre-warm then:

- installs the SDK when nothing is present for that channel;
- installs a newer runtime **side-by-side** and activates it
  (`rocm update --apply --runtime <key> --activate`) when the index is ahead;
- replaces a same-version runtime side-by-side when its manifest has an older or
  missing wheel composition, then activates the composition-keyed replacement;
- treats that repair as complete while the matching replacement remains installed,
  so retained legacy manifests do not trigger repeated repairs or notifications;
- activates the runtime a reuse actually means — after a repair that is the
  replacement named by `target=`, not the superseded manifest the line belongs to;
- ensures the default engine is installed even when the runtime itself is reused;
- reuses the existing tree when it is `up_to_date`, when it is `ahead_of_index`
  (a pinned build newer than the index must not be rolled back and cannot be
  reproduced from the index, so it is never offered a repair), or when freshness
  cannot be established at all — an unreachable index reuses and warns rather than
  re-downloading gigabytes or failing the lane;
- prunes with `rocm storage remove-old-installs` after any install, update, or
  repair, so the multi-version cache stays bounded.

The runtime is always installed **in place**: `install sdk` bakes absolute paths
into the runtime manifest, so a tree that is moved after installation leaves every
serve pointing at a path that no longer exists.

This replaced an existence-only guard that never reinstalled, which had frozen both
MI300X runners on a 16-day-old runtime and left drift from a fresh install untested
(`EAI-8057`). The decision logic lives in `xtask` rather than the workflows because
the pre-warm block is duplicated across multiple jobs in two shells;
`xtask/src/e2e_prewarm.rs` carries unit tests for each freshness verdict, and the
`runtime-update-reports-freshness` scenario pins the `rocm update` output shape those tests assume.

## Blocking vs. non-blocking

The self-hosted jobs — `e2e-gpu`, `e2e-gpu-strix-ubuntu`,
`e2e-gpu-strix-windows`, `e2e-wsl`, `e2e-gpu-rad3`, and `e2e-gpu-mi350p` — all run with
check names that are absent from branch protection's required-status-check
list (see below), so a hardware failure never gates a PR merge no matter how
it reports. Five of them run with `continue-on-error: false`, so a real
regression shows red instead of always green; `e2e-gpu-mi350p` still runs with
`continue-on-error: true`, unchanged and out of scope here. Their results also
surface in the self-hosted consolidated report for visibility.

### Timeouts on the Strix lanes

Every Strix Halo lane raises two budgets rather than letting a slow host read
as a product failure: `E2E_SERVE_TIMEOUT_SECS` for serve readiness, and
`E2E_TUI_TIMEOUT_SECS` for the PTY-driven dashboard waits. On the pool-hosted
Ubuntu/Windows lanes this covers a busy or cold-starting pool host; `e2e-wsl`
additionally shares its physical machine with nothing else in this workflow
now that the other two lanes moved to the pool, but WSL2's own virtualization
overhead can still make a wait that's comfortable on native hardware run long.
Both budgets only lengthen how long a wait may take; a genuine hang still
fails, just later.

**Required-check history.** These job names — and `E2E consolidated report
(self-hosted)` — used to be in `main`'s required-status-check list, where a
required check that *never reports* (because its self-hosted runner is
offline) is treated as missing and still blocks the merge, `continue-on-error`
notwithstanding. That branch-protection change has since landed (confirmed
2026-09-11): none of the self-hosted lane names, nor the self-hosted
consolidated report, are in the required list anymore (`ci.yml`'s own mock
`E2E tests` / `E2E consolidated report` are the required checks — similarly
prefixed but distinct from the self-hosted names above, so no name string
actually collides). An offline or unclaimed self-hosted runner can no longer
block a merge.

## Fork safety

Self-hosted runners are not used for untrusted fork pull requests: GitHub
does not dispatch self-hosted-runner jobs from an external fork's
`pull_request` event without explicit approval. The hardware jobs only run
against branches and PRs within the repository (and on `workflow_dispatch`,
which requires write access to trigger).

## Notes

- The hardware jobs build and run **release** binaries: they assert
  functional behavior (device detection, engine launch, policy enforcement),
  not performance, so this is not a performance benchmark. Release-fidelity,
  `manylinux2014` (glibc 2.17) packaging validation is handled separately by
  the nightly/release pipeline.
- Each workflow's `e2e-report` job collects whatever ran in that workflow —
  including partial results from a cancelled or failed job — and renders one
  HTML report plus a step summary. `download-artifact@v8` flattens a
  single-match download straight into the artifacts directory (it uses the root
  path when exactly one artifact matches, regardless of the pattern), so after
  the split each report job usually has one artifact; `xtask e2e-report`'s
  discovery handles both the flattened and per-subdirectory layouts, labeling a
  root-level report from its `platform.json` slug.
