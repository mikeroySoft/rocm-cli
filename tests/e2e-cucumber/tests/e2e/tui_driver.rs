//! Black-box driver for the interactive dash/chat TUI.
//!
//! The rest of the suite spawns `rocm` with piped stdin/stdout via
//! `std::process::Command`. That can never exercise the interactive dashboard:
//! the CLI only enters the crossterm raw-mode event loop when both stdin and
//! stdout are a real terminal (`rocm_core::interactive_terminal`), and a pipe is
//! not. So the dash was previously "untestable black-box" (e.g. the chat privacy
//! notice) and only had in-process render tests.
//!
//! This driver closes that gap the way a user's terminal does: it spawns the
//! real binary under a pseudo-terminal (`portable-pty`), feeds keystrokes to the
//! master side, and parses the emitted byte stream into an emulated screen grid
//! (`vt100`). Assertions read the *current visible screen* — the same thing a
//! user sees — never the raw output transcript, so stale/erased frames or partial
//! escape sequences can't cause false matches.
//!
//! It stays black-box: it drives the compiled binary and reads its terminal
//! output, importing nothing from the product crates.
