Feature: GPU detection and system inspection

  @id:examine-version
  Scenario: examine-01 - The CLI reports its version
    When the user asks for the version through every CLI surface
    Then matching traceable version strings are returned

  @id:examine-engines-list
  Scenario: examine-02 - The CLI lists all supported engines
    When the user lists available engines
    Then all supported engines are listed

  # EAI-7383: keep the top-level command list alphabetized so it remains easy to
  # scan as commands are added or reordered in the source declaration.
  @id:examine-help-lists-subcommands-alphabetically
  Scenario: examine-03 - The help output lists subcommands in alphabetical order
    When the user asks for help
    Then the subcommands are listed in alphabetical order

  # The target assertion is a cross-check, not a tautology: the expectation comes
  # from the KFD topology in sysfs, while `examine` reaches its answer through the
  # CLI's own probe. Detection used to look for `gfx_target_version` as a standalone
  # file, which no kernel exposes, and silently fell back to decoding a GC IP
  # version -- naming an MI300X `gfx943` instead of `gfx942`. Only the GPU lane can
  # exercise this; there is no KFD topology to read on the mock lane.
  @id:examine-detects-gpu-and-driver @requires-gpu
  Scenario: examine-04 - System inspection detects the GPU and driver
    Given a machine with an AMD GPU
    When the user inspects the system
    Then the inspection reports which GPU is installed
    And the inspection names the GPU target that the kernel reports
    And the inspection reports that the driver is available

  # `examine` used to report a hardcoded platform constant as the default engine,
  # so on Instinct it named Lemonade while `serve` selected vLLM. The assertion is
  # host-agnostic: it compares what `examine` reports against the engine the
  # harness works out for this host from the GPU family and OS, so it resolves to
  # vLLM on Instinct and Lemonade on Strix Halo and on the no-GPU lane without
  # naming either. The harness derives its answer from the GPU probe rather than
  # from `examine`, so this is a cross-check and not a tautology.
  @id:examine-reports-host-default-engine
  Scenario: examine-05 - System inspection names the engine this machine serves on
    When the user inspects the system
    Then the inspection names the engine this host serves on by default

  # No GPU needed: the install is planted by the harness (`plant_unmanaged_rocm`,
  # written precisely so this does not depend on an ambient `/opt/rocm`), and
  # every assertion here is about how a detected install is reported, not about
  # hardware. Dropping `@requires-gpu` gains per-PR mock-lane coverage for the
  # reporting this scenario exists to pin.
  @id:examine-distinguishes-unmanaged-rocm
  Scenario: examine-06 - System inspection distinguishes CLI-managed from pre-existing ROCm
    Given a machine with a ROCm install that was not set up by the CLI
    When the user inspects the system
    Then the inspection reports the install as pre-existing
    And the inspection names that install's version
    And the inspection does not claim nothing is installed
    And the inspection suggests setting up a CLI-managed install

  # The machine-readable form is a separate code path, not a re-rendering of the
  # human one: it used to answer before the CLI had loaded its paths or config,
  # putting every CLI-side fact out of reach. Eleven things the human report
  # states had no field in it at all — among them which engine this host will
  # serve on and whether an existing ROCm install was found. Since fixed (those
  # facts now travel under `summary`), and this is what holds the two forms
  # level: tooling reads this one, and it must not drift back into being the
  # weaker of the two.
  @id:examine-machine-readable-report
  Scenario: examine-07 - What the inspection tells a tool matches what it tells a person
    When the user inspects the system both for reading and for scripting
    Then the machine-readable form states everything the readable one does

  # The harness parses the human text rather than this form because of a defect
  # this scenario caught, and says so in capability.rs — on a real MI300X the
  # machine-readable form reported no AMD GPU on a machine that has one, while
  # Strix Halo (gfx1151) agreed. That workaround makes the disagreement
  # load-bearing: every host capability the suite resolves comes from scraped
  # text, so if the two forms ever diverge again, every capability-keyed
  # expectation silently resolves against the wrong host. Since fixed; this is
  # the guard that keeps it fixed.
  @id:examine-both-forms-agree-on-gpu
  Scenario: examine-08 - Both forms of the inspection agree about the GPU
    When the user inspects the system both for reading and for scripting
    Then both reports agree on whether this machine has an AMD GPU
    And both reports agree on whether this platform is in scope

  # `examine` is an inspector: the outcome says whether it managed to look, not
  # whether it liked what it saw. Finding no GPU is a finding, not a failure.
  # This is the mock lane's to prove — it is the one lane with nothing to find.
  @id:examine-reports-without-failing
  Scenario: examine-09 - Inspecting a machine reports what it finds without failing
    When the user inspects the system
    Then the inspection completes successfully
    And it states a verdict for this machine

  # Leaving the frameworks out is the variant pinned here: the outcome is
  # identical on every host, whereas asserting that a *named* framework was
  # probed would depend on what happens to be installed.
  #
  # @requires-bare-metal because the probe never reaches its framework step on
  # WSL2 — it returns as soon as it recognises the platform — so `framework`
  # stays "unknown" there whatever the flag says. That the probe gives up that
  # early is its own defect, tracked separately; this scenario is about whether
  # the choice is reachable, and it cannot answer that where no choice is acted
  # on at all.
  @id:examine-can-skip-framework-probing @requires-bare-metal
  Scenario: examine-10 - The user can leave the frameworks out of the inspection
    When the user inspects the system without probing frameworks
    Then the inspection reports that it skipped the frameworks
    And it still states a verdict for this machine

  # The inverse of `@requires-bare-metal`: WSL2 reports an os_family of `linux`,
  # so `@requires-os:linux` cannot express "only where the host really is WSL".
  # Runs only on the WSL lane; everywhere else the premise does not exist.
  @id:examine-detects-wsl @requires-wsl
  Scenario: examine-11 - System inspection recognizes a WSL host
    Given the CLI is running in WSL
    When the user inspects the system
    Then the inspection reports Linux as the operating system
    And the inspection reports that the host is WSL

  # The dry-run plan used to print the raw `${ROCM_CLI_AMDGPU_VERSION:-...}` shell
  # placeholder on its `repo_version:` line instead of the effective version, so
  # the preview a user reviews before approving disagreed with what the install
  # would actually pull. The plan is rendered on every Linux host regardless of
  # GPU (the driver is not yet installed when you preview it), so the mock lane
  # pins this without hardware.
  @id:examine-install-driver-dry-run-resolves-repo-version @requires-os:linux
  Scenario: examine-12 - The driver install dry-run shows the effective repo version
    When the user previews the driver install plan
    Then the plan's repo version is a concrete version, not a shell placeholder

  # `rocm engines list` prefixes the engine this machine serves on with `*`,
  # with nothing else on the page explaining what it means. This asserts the
  # printed legend actually names the glyph, and that the marked engine
  # matches the host's independently-derived default, so the rendered marker
  # and its explanation can't drift apart silently.
  @id:examine-engines-list-shows-default-engine-legend
  Scenario: examine-13 - Listing engines explains the default-engine marker
    When the user lists available engines
    Then the engine listing explains the default-engine marker
    And the host's default engine is marked in the listing

  # `rocm examine`'s own engine_inventory block prefixes the effective default
  # engine with the same `*` marker, via a renderer separate from `engines
  # list`'s (see `append_examine_engine_inventory` vs
  # `render_engine_inventory_text_with_paths` in apps/rocm/src/main.rs) — the
  # two used to be able to drift apart. examine-13 only ever drove `engines
  # list`, leaving this second renderer's legend unexercised end-to-end.
  @id:examine-shows-default-engine-legend
  Scenario: examine-14 - Inspecting the system explains the default-engine marker
    When the user inspects the system
    Then the inspection explains the default-engine marker
    And the host's default engine is marked in the inspection's engine inventory

  # In the managed configuration torch is installed only inside the active
  # runtime, so a probe that resolves its interpreter from `PATH` reports
  # `framework: unknown` for a machine that has a working one — and the
  # machine-readable form is the only surface that reports a framework at all,
  # so there is nothing to cross-check it against.
  #
  # `Given a managed runtime is active` is what lets this scenario fail. Without
  # it the world's `<data>/runtimes` stays isolated and empty by design (see
  # `E2eWorld::default`), no interpreter resolves, and any assertion would land
  # on the `PATH` fallback — holding whether the fix is present or reverted.
  # That precondition is also why this is `@requires-gpu`: the step installs the
  # SDK, so only a GPU lane exercises it.
  #
  # `framework_source` is what check_8 reads to decide whether comparing this
  # torch against the *system* ROCm means anything, so it is the field worth
  # pinning rather than the versions themselves.
  @id:examine-framework-names-the-interpreter-that-answered @requires-gpu
  Scenario: examine-15 - The framework report describes the runtime the engines will use
    Given a managed runtime is active
    When the user inspects the system both for reading and for scripting
    Then the framework report names the runtime's interpreter
  # EAI-8950. The text form repairs a lost registry entry from the install tree
  # before rendering (`recover_setup_runtime_registration`), so it names the
  # folder; `--json` skips that call because it writes, and used to answer
  # `active_runtime_root: null` with no folder anywhere in the document. The
  # folder is reachable from config without the registry and without writing,
  # which is what these fields carry.
  #
  # The order of the two runs is load-bearing: the `Given` plants an install
  # tree the text form CAN repair from, so running it first would hand `--json`
  # an `active_runtime_root` it is supposed to have no way to resolve. The
  # machine-readable form goes FIRST, while the registry is still empty; the
  # text form follows so the two answers can be held against each other.
  #
  # No GPU needed: config and install tree are planted, and the isolated
  # registry is empty by design (see `E2eWorld::default`) — which is precisely
  # the missing-entry state under test.
  @id:examine-json-names-the-setup-runtime-folder
  Scenario: examine-16 - The scripting form names the setup runtime folder unaided
    Given setup names a runtime folder the registry has forgotten
    When the user inspects the system for scripting before reading
    Then the machine-readable form names the setup runtime folder
    And it does not pass that folder off as the active runtime's

  # EAI-8449: Instinct parts enumerate under PCI class 1200 ("Processing
  # accelerators") rather than a display class, so the lspci probe skipped them
  # and the machine-readable form fell back to a single topology-sourced entry
  # carrying no PCI address -- one row for an eight-GPU MI300X host. Neither
  # examine-04 nor examine-08 noticed, because both assert `detected_gfx_target`
  # and `has_amd_gpu`, which that fallback still satisfied. So this reads
  # `gpus[]` itself, cross-checked against the kernel's own GPU node count
  # rather than against a fixed number, which keeps it host-agnostic.
  #
  # It also reads `gpus[].gfx_target`, which is the observable end of the second
  # half of that fix: `lspci` resolves a target from the marketing name, and on
  # an Instinct host `pci.ids` frequently spells that "Device 74a1", so without
  # `rocminfo` the per-node target the kernel reports is the only thing that can
  # fill the field.
  #
  # The step no-ops where a premise does not hold -- no readable KFD topology,
  # no `lspci` to supply PCI addresses, or a topology whose nodes disagree on a
  # target -- because on such a host the answer it would otherwise flag is the
  # correct one.
  @id:examine-lists-every-gpu-with-its-address-and-target @requires-gpu
  Scenario: examine-17 - The machine-readable report lists every GPU the kernel sees
    Given a machine with an AMD GPU
    When the user inspects the system both for reading and for scripting
    Then it lists one AMD GPU per kernel GPU node, each with its PCI address and gfx target

  # HIP compiles device code at run time through a library a machine can hold
  # more than one copy of — a system ROCm install and a ROCm Python wheel each
  # ship one, and this CLI installs the second itself. When the copy that loads
  # is not the one the active runtime needs, compilation fails with an error
  # naming neither the library nor the second copy. Nothing looked past the
  # first match before, so the second copy could not be seen at all.
  #
  # No GPU needed: the suite cannot install a second ROCm stack, so it cannot
  # prove the two-copy case. What every lane can prove is that the inspection
  # answers the question at all rather than staying silent, and that finding
  # none is reported as a finding rather than a failure — which is the case
  # the mock lane actually has. The two-copy behaviour is proven by unit tests
  # that build the directory layout directly.
  #
  # `@requires-os:linux` because `probe_comgr` only runs for `os_family`
  # "linux" or "wsl" (see `examine.rs`); on native Windows it is never called,
  # so `comgr_paths: []` and `comgr_selected: null` would hold by nothing more
  # than `Examination`'s own defaults, and the assertions below would pass
  # whether the probe ran and found nothing or never ran at all. WSL reports
  # `os_family` "linux" (see `expectation.rs`), so this still runs there.
  @id:examine-reports-code-object-manager-copies @requires-os:linux
  Scenario: examine-18 - The inspection says which code object manager libraries the machine holds
    When the user inspects the system in machine-readable form
    Then the inspection lists the code object manager libraries it found
    And it names which of them would load, or says it found none
    And it lists the HIP runtime libraries the machine holds the same way
    And it names which HIP runtime copy would load, or says it found none

  # The copy this CLI installs itself, which is the case the whole entry exists
  # for: the install path puts ROCm wheels into a managed environment, so a user
  # on a host that already carries system ROCm ends up holding both copies
  # having done nothing unusual.
  #
  # `@requires-gpu` because the precondition installs the SDK, and only a GPU
  # lane does that. This is the half the unit tests cannot reach: they build the
  # directory layout by hand, so they prove the search understands a layout we
  # described, not that it matches the one the installer actually produces. A
  # real managed runtime is the only thing that distinguishes those.
  #
  # `@requires-os:linux` because `probe_comgr` only ever looks for `libamd_comgr`
  # and `libamdhip64` -- ELF shared-object names, found via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`,
  # the loader cache, or an install root's `lib/` tree. None of that exists on
  # native Windows, which ships `.dll`s under other names, so the assertion
  # that a managed runtime's library must be found does not hold there. WSL
  # reports `os_family` "linux" (see `expectation.rs`), so this still runs on
  # the WSL lane, where the managed runtime really does carry a `.so`. This
  # matches `check_18_comgr_conflict`'s own `&["linux", "wsl"]` gate in
  # diagnose.rs -- the same boundary, stated once there and once here.
  @id:examine-finds-the-managed-runtimes-own-compilation-library @requires-gpu @requires-os:linux
  Scenario: examine-19 - The inspection finds the compilation library the CLI installed itself
    Given a managed runtime is active
    When the user inspects the system in machine-readable form
    Then the inspection attributes a code object manager library to that runtime
