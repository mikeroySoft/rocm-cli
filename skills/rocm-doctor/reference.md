# ROCm Doctor — reference

The closed failure-mode catalog and the CLI it drives. The catalog is
authoritative in the `rocm` CLI (`crates/rocm-core`); this file mirrors it for
humans. To add or change a failure mode, change the CLI catalog — not this doc.

## CLI commands

### `rocm examine [--json]`

Inspect the host: GPU + gfx target, driver, ROCm install, render/video groups,
`/dev/kfd` + render devices, kernel modules, framework introspection, recent
amdgpu kernel-log evidence. `--json` emits the **Examination** document for
tooling.

- It's a general system inspector, so it **always exits 0**. The verdict is the
  `status` field: `ok` · `no-amd-gpu` · `wsl` · `unsupported-os` · `degraded`.

### `rocm diagnose [--symptom "<text>"] [--top N] [--json] [--distro [NAME]] [--model REF]`

Match the host + symptom against the closed catalog. **Always exits 0**; read
the result from `--json`:

- `matched[]` — ranked `{ id, title, score, evidence[], fix }`. Tiers:
  `>= 75` high confidence, `50–74` likely, `< 50` weak.
- `has_match` — whether any entry cleared `min_score_for_match`. **This is the
  gate, not whether `matched` is empty.** Several checkers open with a nonzero
  base score for a merely *potentially* relevant situation (running in a
  container, an APU alongside a discrete GPU), so a healthy host produces a
  non-empty `matched` full of sub-threshold entries. Gating on emptiness
  proposes a fix for a machine with nothing wrong and never routes upstream.
- `min_score_for_match` (50), `high_confidence_threshold` (75).
- `out_of_scope` — set when the host's platform family has **no catalog entries
  at all**, in which case `matched` is empty. Linux, Windows and WSL2 are all
  covered, so this now fires only for a platform outside those three. It means
  nothing was checked — not a clean bill of health.
- `route_when_no_match` — `{ target, url }` upstream tracker to use when `has_match` is false.
- `model` — set only when `--model <ref>` was passed; otherwise not set. Answers
  "will this curated model run here" from the recipe catalog and this host's
  GPU/RAM, without downloading anything: `{ verdict, evidence[], engine,
  required_gpu_memory_gib, available_gpu_memory_gib, alternatives[],
  undetermined_reason, fix }`. `verdict` is one of `ready`, `degraded`,
  `blocked`, `undetermined` — treat `undetermined` as "the CLI could not find
  out", never as evidence the model is incompatible. `--model` is refused
  together with `--distro`: the verdict is about the machine running the
  command, not the one `--distro` names.

### `rocm fix [<id>] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--device-index N]`

Apply a fix by id (run with no id to list). Exit codes:

| code | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | applied / dry-run / print-only plan / list |
| 1 | internal error |
| 2 | usage error (incl. unknown fix-id) |
| 3 | not applicable on this host (OS mismatch, negative `--device-index`) — nothing changed |
| 4 | attempted but the command failed |
| 5 | user declined at the prompt |

Three ids are ever auto-applicable — never four, and `fix-9-igpu-dgpu` is not
one of them (see below) — and which of the three depends on the **host**,
because `rocm fix`'s listing marks each entry for the machine you run it on,
never for every machine the id applies to:

- **linux** — auto-applicable: `fix-4-render-group`, `fix-6-path`.
- **windows** — auto-applicable: `fix-2-unset-override`, `fix-6-path`.
- **wsl** — auto-applicable: `fix-6-path`.

The rest print their plan for the user to run. Pass the **full** id
(`rocm fix fix-2-unset-override`, not `rocm fix fix-2`; a short id returns
exit 2, unknown fix-id).

**Marker** in the catalog below is what `rocm fix`'s listing reports **on
bare-metal Linux** — AUTO means the CLI has a runner for the entry and will
carry it out itself there, rather than printing a plan for the user. It is not
a promise that the runner mutates anything, and — per the per-host list above — it is
not the same claim on Windows or WSL2 for the one entry whose behaviour
depends on more than the host alone.

The ones that do mutate print the exact command, honor `--dry-run`, refuse on a
non-interactive shell without `--yes`, and confirm first. **Two exceptions:**

- **`fix-2-unset-override` mutates on Windows only.** Its Linux runner reports
  where the override is set and which rc files carry it, then stops — it will
  not edit your dotfiles. So on Linux it never prompts, `--dry-run` has nothing
  to preview, and `--yes` is never read. Do not tell a Linux user a dry run
  previewed a change that was never going to happen.
- **`fix-9-igpu-dgpu` needs `--device-index N` wherever it applies (Linux and
  Windows) and is never marked AUTO.** Without the flag the runner just prints
  the `rocminfo`/`hipInfo` query that identifies which index is the discrete
  GPU and returns 0: no prompt, nothing for `--dry-run` to preview, nothing
  pinned. Run `rocm fix fix-9-igpu-dgpu --device-index N` (not the bare id)
  once you know N.

## Closed catalog (25 failure modes)

The OS column is the platform family the CLI scopes an entry to, and WSL2 is a
family of its own — not a flavour of `linux`. An entry reaches a WSL host only
by naming `wsl`, so the bare-metal Linux entries (the `amdgpu` module,
`/dev/kfd`, the render group) stop applying there automatically rather than
reporting confident nonsense.

| id | OS | Failure mode | Typical signal | Marker (bare-metal Linux) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `fix-18-comgr-conflict` | linux/wsl | The code object manager library (`libamd_comgr`) that would load belongs to a different installation than the HIP runtime that would load, so device code compilation fails with an error naming neither | compilation error naming neither library; `rocm examine --json`'s `comgr_selected`/`hip_selected` resolve to two different `install_root`s | print-only |
| `fix-19-shm-too-small` | linux/wsl | `/dev/shm` too small for a serving workload, which needs gigabytes where a container and WSL2 both default to 64 MB | reported under 1 GiB; a data-loader worker killed by a bus error, or a failed write to a temporary file, with nothing naming shared memory | print-only |

| `fix-wsl-5-distro-too-old` | wsl | Distro release below the floor the WSL path requires | distro release under the supported floor (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04, whose glibc 2.35 is below the 2.38 / `GLIBCXX_3.4.32` the engines need) | print-only |
| `fix-wsl-6-host-driver-too-old` | wsl | Windows host driver too old or absent, with the distro side already complete | the Windows host reports no AMD display adapter | print-only |
| `fix-wsl-7-wsl1` | wsl | Distro running under WSL 1, which exposes no GPU device at all | the running kernel is a WSL 1 kernel | print-only |

Two things the numbering does not tell you. `fix-16` is a reserved handle, not a
missing row — ids are stable handles rather than positions. And the `fix-wsl-N`
entries are a parallel series, not a continuation of the numeric one, because
they answer for a different platform family.

Linux-only: fix-3, -4, -5, -7, -10, -11, -12, -17. Windows-only: fix-13, -14, -15.
WSL-only: fix-wsl-1 through fix-wsl-7. Linux + Windows: fix-9.
Linux + WSL: fix-18, -19. Linux + Windows + WSL: fix-1, -2, -6, -8.

## Framework routing

`rocm diagnose` diagnoses frameworks built against the **system** ROCm/HIP:

- **PyTorch**, **llama.cpp** — in scope.

Apps that ship their own runtime are routed upstream **by the skill**, from the
table below. The CLI cannot do it: `route_when_no_match` keys off the
host-detected framework, which `rocm examine` only ever reports as `pytorch`,
`llama-cpp`, `unknown` or `skipped`, so it has no arm for these apps.

- **Lemonade** → https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade/issues
- **Ollama** → https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues
- **LM Studio** → in-app support (no public repo)

`route_when_no_match` itself returns one of:

- **pytorch** → https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues (tag with the rocm label)
- **llama-cpp** → https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues
- otherwise **rocm-core** → https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues

## Out of scope

- NVIDIA / Intel / Apple Silicon GPUs; fresh installs on a clean machine.

WSL2 used to sit here and no longer does: it is a supported platform family with
its own seven catalog entries. It remains a *distinct* platform — the GPU
arrives over `/dev/dxg` from the Windows host driver, not through the in-tree
`amdgpu` module or `/dev/kfd` — which is why it gets its own entries rather than
inheriting the bare-metal Linux ones. AMD's ROCm-on-WSL guide is still the right
pointer for install questions the catalog does not cover:
