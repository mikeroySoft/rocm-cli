//! Steps for the ROCm-preserving guard on automatic system-package installs.
//!
//! `rocm engines install vllm` installs the OpenMPI runtime vLLM needs through
//! the host package manager. `apt-get install -y` assumes yes for *removals* as
//! well as installs, so a dependency solution that evicts the ROCm stack used to
//! be applied without asking. These steps stand in for the package manager so a
//! scenario can present that exact solution and assert the CLI refuses it.
