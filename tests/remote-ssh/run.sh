# Check the assumptions `rocm remote` makes about the tools it drives, against a
# real OpenSSH server rather than a stand-in.
#
# Scope, stated plainly: this exercises the *tools and their contracts* — ssh,
# scp, the service listing, the serve config — not the Rust call paths, which
# are unit-tested against a scripted transport. The transport is private to a
# binary crate, so no integration test can reach it. What is proven here is that
# the behaviour those unit tests assume is the behaviour the real tools have.
#
# Usage: tests/remote-ssh/run.sh
# Requires: docker, ssh, scp, jq. No GPU, no ROCm, no tailnet.
