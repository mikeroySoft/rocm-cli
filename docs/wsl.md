# WSL Support Notes

This note tracks the WSL path for `rocm-cli` with TheRock-managed Python
virtual environments and ROCDXG (`librocdxg`).

## Prerequisites

The AMD WSL path is:

1. Windows 11 with the AMD Adrenalin WSL-capable driver.
2. WSL2 with Ubuntu 24.04 or newer. Ubuntu 22.04 is not supported: it ships
   glibc 2.35, below the glibc 2.38 / `GLIBCXX_3.4.32` floor that every
   published Lemonade embeddable requires, so the Lemonade engine cannot start
   there. Ubuntu 24.04 provides glibc 2.39 and `GLIBCXX_3.4.33`.
3. ROCDXG (`librocdxg`) installed inside WSL.
4. A TheRock runtime installed by `rocm-cli` into a managed Python venv.

Useful read-only preflight, from inside the distro:

```bash
rocm diagnose
rocm diagnose --json
```

From Windows PowerShell, inspect a distro without installing anything in it:

```powershell
rocm diagnose --distro          # the only distro installed
rocm diagnose --distro Ubuntu   # a named one
```

The host-side form collects the facts over `wsl.exe` and runs the same catalog.
It needs no `rocm-cli`, and no Python, inside the target distro — which is the
point, since the distro being checked is usually the one that is not set up yet.

It sees less than a run from inside, so prefer the in-distro form where you can:

- It probes the conventional ROCm roots (`/opt/rocm*`, `/usr/local/rocm*`) but
  cannot honour a `$ROCM_PATH` pointing elsewhere. `wsl.exe --exec` runs a
  non-login, non-interactive shell, so nothing exported from a shell profile is
  set.
- For the same reason it collects no environment, so the checks that read one —
  `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION`, `PATH`, and the framework/ROCm version pairing —
  do not run. It reports on the WSL GPU stack, not on the whole installation.

## Install ROCDXG In WSL

Use the CLI:

```bash
rocm install driver            # print the plan
rocm install driver --yes      # run it
```

On WSL2 this installs ROCDXG rather than Linux DKMS — there is no in-tree
amdgpu driver to build, because the GPU comes from the Windows host driver
through `/dev/dxg`. The plan is printed for review first and only runs with
`--yes`, the same as on bare metal. It checks `/dev/dxg` and dxcore before
touching anything, installs the release package, runs `ldconfig`, and then
verifies that `/opt/rocm/lib/librocdxg.so` exists and is visible to the linker.
No reboot is needed: ROCDXG is userspace.

Confirm afterwards with `rocm examine`, which should report
`driver_status: wsl_rocdxg_ready`.

The download is verified before it is installed. `rocm install driver` carries a
SHA-256 digest for each published ROCDXG release and checks the `.deb` against
it; on a mismatch the plan stops before `apt install` runs the package's
maintainer scripts as root. Nothing needs to be set for this.

To install a release other than the pinned one, set `ROCM_CLI_ROCDXG_VERSION`.
Because rocm-cli has no digest for a release it predates, supply one:

```bash
ROCM_CLI_ROCDXG_VERSION=<version> \
ROCM_CLI_ROCDXG_SHA256=<64-hex-sha256> rocm install driver --yes
```

`ROCM_CLI_ROCDXG_SHA256` also overrides the pinned digest for a known version.
If you genuinely want to install without verifying, that has to be said out
loud — the plan then prints a warning naming the version it is not checking:

```bash
ROCM_CLI_ROCDXG_VERSION=<version> \
ROCM_CLI_ROCDXG_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED=1 rocm install driver --yes
```

Without one of those, an unpinned version is refused rather than installed
unverified.

### Doing it by hand

The equivalent manual steps, for reference or for a host where the CLI is not
installed yet. The `sha256sum -c` line is the same trust anchor `rocm install
driver` uses — `apt install` runs the package's maintainer scripts as root, so
do not skip it. The digest below is the one rocm-cli pins for 1.2.2; for a
different release, take the digest published with it:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
curl -L -o /tmp/rocdxg-roct_1.2.2_amd64.deb \
  https://github.com/ROCm/librocdxg/releases/download/v1.2.2/rocdxg-roct_1.2.2_amd64.deb
printf '%s  %s\n' \
  28ded1254811192ebace1f76c0227580184af7b27ab2475fb9728295a702d541 \
  /tmp/rocdxg-roct_1.2.2_amd64.deb | sha256sum -c -
sudo apt install -y /tmp/rocdxg-roct_1.2.2_amd64.deb
sudo ldconfig
```

Source-build alternative:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/librocdxg.git
cd librocdxg
export win_sdk="/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/Include/10.0.26100.0"
if [ -f "${win_sdk}/shared/dxcore_interface.h" ]; then
  win_sdk_include="${win_sdk}/shared"
elif [ -f "${win_sdk}/um/dxcore_interface.h" ]; then
  win_sdk_include="${win_sdk}/um"
else
  echo "DXCore headers were not found under ${win_sdk}" >&2
  exit 1
fi
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DWIN_SDK="${win_sdk_include}"
make -j"$(nproc)"
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

For legacy ROCm releases, set:

```bash
export HSA_ENABLE_DXG_DETECTION=1
```

ROCK/TheRock 7.13 and newer should not require that variable, but setting it is
still useful for compatibility checks while the WSL path is being hardened.

## TheRock Runtime Env In WSL

`rocm-cli` should continue to own the Python venv. Do not rely on an externally
created venv such as `D:\ROCm\venv`.

The WSL activation environment for HIP applications that do not preload ROCm
the way PyTorch does must include the managed TheRock runtime package paths and
WSL DXCore path. With the managed `rocm[libraries]` install, these paths
come from the rocm-cli runtime manifest, `rocm-sdk path --root`, and
`rocm_sdk.find_libraries(...)`. `rocm[libraries]` is enough to run a pre-built
HIP application; compiling one from source under WSL needs the compiler and
headers, so run `rocm install sdk --devel` instead.

```bash
export ROCM_ROOT="<managed _rocm_sdk_core or devel root from the runtime manifest>"
export ROCM_PATH="${ROCM_ROOT}"
export ROCM_HOME="${ROCM_ROOT}"
export HIP_PATH="${ROCM_ROOT}"
export PATH="<managed TheRock bin dirs>:${PATH}"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="<managed TheRock library dirs>:/usr/lib/wsl/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}"
```

For `rocm-cli`, the command itself should resolve the managed runtime manifest
and apply that environment before launching HIP apps such as Lemonade's bundled
`llama.cpp` backend. Users should not have to hand-export these values.

## Diagnosing A WSL Host

`rocm diagnose` carries a WSL catalog, separate from the bare-metal Linux one.
The bare-metal checks (render group, `/dev/kfd`, `modprobe amdgpu`, `iommu=pt`)
never run here: WSL has no `amdgpu` module and no `/dev/kfd`, so a finding
naming one would send you after a fault that cannot exist on this platform.

```bash
rocm diagnose
rocm diagnose --json
```

This catalog replaces the standalone preflight script this repo used to ship;
it does not carry over that script's `--require-build-tools` flag or its
Python venv-tooling check, so a distro missing only build tools or `venv`
support reports clean here.

The WSL entries, in the order a broken stack usually reveals them:

| Fix id | Reported when |
| --- | --- |
| `fix-wsl-7-wsl1` | The distro runs under WSL 1, which has no GPU path at all |
| `fix-wsl-1-gpu-not-exposed` | `/dev/dxg` is missing. Names which of the three causes applies: a container started without the device, a distro with no WSL GPU support wired in, or the Windows host driver |
| `fix-wsl-2-dxcore-missing` | `libdxcore.so` is absent or off the loader path |
| `fix-wsl-3-rocdxg-missing` | ROCDXG is not installed in the distro |
| `fix-wsl-4-rocdxg-not-linked` | ROCDXG is installed but absent from the linker cache |
| `fix-wsl-5-distro-too-old` | The distro release is below the floor in the prerequisites above |
| `fix-wsl-6-host-driver-too-old` | The distro-side plumbing is complete but the Windows host driver is missing or too old |

One entry outside this list also applies here. `fix-19-shm-too-small` is not a
WSL entry, but WSL2 ships the same 64 MiB `/dev/shm` a container does, and a
serving workload needs gigabytes of it. It reports below 1 GiB, so a WSL2 user
can meet it on an otherwise healthy stack. Its guidance names the container and
bare-metal cases; under WSL2 the remedy is the host one, remounting `/dev/shm`
larger and adding the matching `/etc/fstab` line inside the distro.

Every WSL remedy is print-only. `rocm fix <id>` shows the commands and does not
run them: they either install packages with `sudo`, edit loader configuration, or
belong to the Windows host, and none of that meets the bar the four
auto-applicable fixes clear.

Two deliberate silences, so a report can be trusted:

- `fix-wsl-6` **abstains** when WSL interop cannot reach the Windows host, rather
  than reading "could not ask" as "driver is too old". Inside a container, or
  with interop switched off, the host driver is reported as unknown and no
  finding blames it.
- `fix-wsl-5` **abstains** when the distro release cannot be parsed. An
  unreadable release is not evidence of a supported one, but it is not evidence
  of an old one either.

## What `rocm examine` Reports On WSL

`rocm examine` detects WSL cheaply and reports:

- `wsl: true`
- WSL distro/version, and whether the release clears the supported floor
- WSL major version (1 or 2)
- `/dev/dxg` presence
- `/usr/lib/wsl/lib/libdxcore.so` presence
- `librocdxg.so` presence, resolved across every ROCm install rather than
  assuming `/opt/rocm`
- `librocdxg` linker-cache visibility from `ldconfig -p`
- the Windows host AMD driver version, when WSL interop can reach the host
- whether `HSA_ENABLE_DXG_DETECTION` is set
- managed TheRock runtime count and active/default runtime

The driver, device-node and group probes stay skipped, so `has_amd_gpu` and
`gpus` describe the bare-metal view and are not populated here.

## Install UX Recommendations

`rocm install sdk` inside WSL should:

- default to a managed pip venv, same as native Linux and Windows
- avoid installing global WSL packages unless the user explicitly approves
- fail clearly when WSL GPU prerequisites are absent
- after install, validate `python -m rocm_sdk version`,
  `python -m rocm_sdk targets`, runtime library discovery through
  `rocm_sdk.find_libraries`, and at least one HIP-visible GPU probe when
  ROCDXG is ready

`rocm setup` in WSL should offer a staged plan:

1. Verify WSL/DXCore.
2. Explain missing ROCDXG if absent.
3. Ask before any `sudo apt install` or `sudo make install`.
4. Install TheRock into a managed venv.
5. Install a serving engine (Lemonade or vLLM).
6. Run a tiny GPU smoke test with CPU fallback disabled.

## Non-Destructive Tests

Safe tests that do not mutate global WSL state:

- `rocm diagnose --json`
- `rocm diagnose --distro <name>` from the Windows host
- `cargo test -p rocm-core wsl` for the catalog's own tests
- `rocm install sdk --channel release --format wheel --dry-run` inside WSL with
  isolated `ROCM_CLI_*` directories

Gated tests that require explicit opt-in because they may download packages or
need `sudo`:

- install ROCDXG `.deb`
- build ROCDXG from source
- install TheRock wheels into a fresh managed WSL venv
- install a serving engine (Lemonade or vLLM)
- run tiny inference on GPU
