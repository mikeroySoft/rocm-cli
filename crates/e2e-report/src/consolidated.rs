         endpoint that engine would expose (`/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`). \

         forwarding — with no GPU, no model download, and no engine process, so it \
         runs on a GitHub-hosted runner. It **gates the PR**: it runs on every push, \
         and if it fails the PR's required check goes red and the PR cannot merge. \
         **Every other platform** is a real self-hosted GPU host running real \
         engines — the rows below are the list, so naming them here would only go \
         stale as lanes are added. They are **non-blocking**: they still run and \
         are reported here, but \
         a failure does NOT block the PR from merging (the hardware/runners are still \

         scenario on Mock); **Fail** = unexpected — a scenario that should pass but \
         failed, or a known bug that unexpectedly passed (its tag is now stale). \
