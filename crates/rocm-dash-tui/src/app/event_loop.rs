/// # Why this reads the latch instead of claiming it
///
/// [`SHUTTING_DOWN`] is a one-shot *process-exit* arbiter: whoever claims it
/// restores the terminal and calls `process::exit`, and nothing ever releases
/// it because there is no "after" to release into. `run` returning is the one
/// teardown with an after — bare `rocm` is a persistent hub, so `run` hands
/// control back to a live launcher menu that must keep painting, keep honouring
/// Ctrl-C, and keep being killable. Claiming the latch here wedged all three at
/// once: the render gate refused every subsequent launcher frame (a blank front
/// door), [`exit_on_ctrl_c`] parked forever, and every later `await_termination`
/// lost the claim and returned without exiting — a signal-swallowing, blank,
/// unkillable hub after the user's first flow.
///

/// the exit, it owns the teardown and is microseconds from ending the process,
/// and a second restore here would be pure redundancy. Otherwise this session
/// restores the terminal and leaves the latch untouched for the windows that
/// come after it.
///
/// Single-writer is preserved by [`RESTORE_LOCK`] inside [`restore_terminal`]
/// rather than by this read, which is deliberately racy on its own: `abort()`
/// above cannot stop a watcher already resumed past its `.await` and inside its
/// own synchronous `restore_terminal(); process::exit(code)`, so a SIGTERM
/// landing in the same instant the user presses `q` can still put two threads on
/// this path. They serialise on the lock; they no longer contend for the latch.

/// and a vanished controlling terminal must not turn teardown into a panic.
///
/// # Ordering against the renderer
///
/// This writer is genuinely concurrent with the renderer: the watcher runs on a
/// Tokio worker thread while frames are drawn on the thread that owns the loop
/// (`block_on`'s thread for a dashboard session, the synchronous menu thread for
/// the launcher hub). A frame that lands *after* this function's bytes cannot
/// re-enter the alternate screen — `EnterAlternateScreen` is emitted exactly
/// once at startup and `Terminal::draw` never re-emits it — but every frame ends
/// by hiding the cursor (`Terminal::draw` emits `Hide` unconditionally when the
/// frame sets no cursor position), so a late frame undoes the show-cursor half of
/// this restore and leaves the user with an invisible cursor.
///
/// Gating the loops on [`shutdown_claimed_on`] is necessary but *not* sufficient,
/// and the gap is not cosmetic: the claim cannot stop a frame that already passed
/// the gate, and that frame's tail is written after these bytes. Measured, rather
/// than argued — SIGINT delivered to a real `rocm dash --demo` under a pty, 300
/// runs on a loaded Linux box: 6 of them ended with this restore spliced into the
/// middle of a frame (`…;48;` `ESC[?1049l … ESC[?25h` `2;19;20;22m qui…ESC[?25l`),
/// leaving the alternate screen with the cursor still hidden. That is exactly
/// what the E2E scenario `dash-sigint-restores-terminal` reported from the WSL2
/// lane, and it reproduces identically on the commits before this PR, so it is
/// the long-standing shape of the race and not a new one.
///
/// So the window is closed rather than accepted: [`TERMINAL_WRITE_LOCK`] is held
/// across one whole frame and across one whole restore, and both render loops
/// re-check the latch *while holding it*. Every interleaving then ends with these
/// bytes last — either the frame completes first and this restore follows it, or
/// this restore goes first and the gate suppresses the frame behind it.
///
/// This adds no new hang: a renderer blocked mid-frame on a full terminal blocks
/// this restore's own writes to that same terminal just as surely, so the lock
/// can only make us wait where we were already waiting.
///
/// # Ordering against another restore
///
/// The same lock covers the second hazard. Two teardowns can run at once: a
/// signal watcher resumed past its `.await` races [`run`]'s clean-quit teardown
/// (which deliberately does not claim the exit latch — see
/// [`restore_after_session`]), and two watchers on two runtimes both wake on one
