# Runs a bash script inside the pinned WSL guest.
#
# Piping script text to `wsl.exe` from Windows PowerShell 5.1 is unreliable:
# - Piping a *string* prepends a UTF-8 BOM to the native process's stdin, even
#   with an explicit no-BOM UTF8Encoding assigned to $OutputEncoding.
# - Piping a *byte[]* doesn't write raw bytes either -- PowerShell enumerates
#   the array and stringifies each element, so bash sees "112 10 111 ..."
#   (each byte's decimal value) instead of the script text.
# Writing the script to a file with .NET's WriteAllText (true no-BOM control)
# and executing that file by path sidesteps both: no pipe, no marshaling.
#
# The WSL path is built manually instead of shelling out to `wslpath`: passing
# a Windows temp path (e.g. C:\Users\...\tmp1234.tmp) as a bare argument to
# `wsl -- wslpath` silently strips every backslash before wslpath sees it, so
# it fails and leaves nothing to convert. Default WSL2 automount always
# exposes drive letters at /mnt/<lowercase-letter>, so the translation is a
# one-line string replace.
#
# The script text is also normalized to LF-only: it's checked out from a
# CRLF-line-ended .yml file on Windows, and bash's `\` line-continuation only
# works when the backslash is immediately followed by a bare LF -- `\<CR><LF>`
# ends the statement early instead of continuing it.
