//! The control channel to a remote GPU host.
//!
//! `rocm remote` needs exactly two things from a remote machine: run a command
//! and read its output, and copy a file over. [`Transport`] captures those and
//! nothing else, so the orchestration above it stays agnostic to how the host is
//! reached. [`SshTransport`] is the one real implementation.
//!
//! Why shell out to the system `ssh`/`scp` instead of a Rust SSH crate: the
//! user's existing keys, agent, `~/.ssh/config`, `ProxyJump` hosts, and host
//! aliases all keep working with no extra configuration, and there is no new
//! dependency surface for something as security-sensitive as an SSH client. It
//! also keeps this code synchronous, matching the command handlers around it.
//!
//! Note what is deliberately *absent*: there is no port-forwarding method. An
//! earlier prototype opened a detached `ssh -L` tunnel and tracked its PID; this
//! design instead has the remote publish its own service onto the tailnet, so
//! the data path never runs through the control channel and no local process
//! outlives the command.
