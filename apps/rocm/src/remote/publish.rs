//! Publishing a remote machine's loopback service onto the tailnet.
//!
//! This is the data path, and it is declared *by the remote*, not held open by
//! us. `rocm serve` binds `127.0.0.1` on the GPU machine as it always has; the
//! machine then tells its own Tailscale daemon to accept tailnet connections on
//! a port and forward them to that loopback address. Nothing on this end stays
//! running, which is why an endpoint survives the command that created it and
//! is reachable from the user's other machines rather than only this one.
//!
//! The cost of that, and the reason [`super`] insists on a credential: a
//! publish is visible to the whole tailnet, scoped only by its ACLs. That
//! assumes Tailscale Funnel is not already enabled for the port — Funnel is
//! what turns a tailnet-scoped forward into one reachable from the public
//! internet, and it is not something this module ever asks for. If the remote
//! already has it allowed for the target port, [`classify`] reports it as a
//! distinct state rather than folding it into "free", and both [`publish`]
//! and [`withdraw`] refuse to act until it is turned off by hand. Unlike a
//! point-to-point tunnel a publish also *outlives a reboot*, because it is
//! configuration rather than a process. A publish left behind is a GPU endpoint
//! nobody is tracking, so withdrawal is treated as a first-class operation that
//! reports failure loudly instead of being assumed to have worked.
//!
//! **Unverified against a live tailnet.** The command shapes below follow
//! Tailscale's documented surface, and the parsing follows the `ServeConfig`
//! struct definition, but neither has been run against a real daemon here.
//! Confirm both before relying on this.
