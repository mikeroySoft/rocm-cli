//! Host capability probe for the E2E suite.
//!
//! The suite is black-box (it never imports rocm-cli crates), but its
//! per-scenario expectations must still follow the product's real behaviour —
//! chiefly *which serve engine the CLI would pick on this host*. We learn that
//! by spawning the real binary (`rocm examine` + `rocm engines list`) once at
//! startup and caching the result.
//!
//! IMPORTANT — the effective serve engine is RE-IMPLEMENTED here (see
//! [`effective_serve_engine`]), duplicating the product's `select_serve_engine` /
//! `preferred_serve_engine_for_therock_family` logic. It will drift if the product
//! changes engine support, so the unit tests below guard it.
//!
//! The AMD GPU *count* is re-implemented for the same reason (see
//! [`probe_amd_gpu_count`]): no `rocm` command reports one, so a scenario whose
//! premise is a multi-GPU host has nothing else to gate on.
//!
//! `examine`'s `default_engine` now reports the host's real engine rather than the
//! old hardcoded `"lemonade"` constant, so this could in principle be replaced by
//! reading the product's own answer. Deliberately KEEP the re-implementation: the
//! `examine-reports-host-default-engine` scenario asserts the product's value
//! against this one, and that check is only meaningful while the two are derived
//! independently. Reading the product value here would turn it into a tautology.
