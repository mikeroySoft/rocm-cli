//! Free-space preflight checks and out-of-space error reporting.
//!
//! ROCm SDK installs download multi-gigabyte tarballs and extract them, so a
//! nearly-full disk otherwise surfaces as a raw low-level write failure partway
//! through the install. This module provides:
//!
//! * [`available_space_for_path`] — free space on the filesystem that will
//!   actually hold a path (not the current directory).
//! * [`ensure_space_for`] / [`warn_if_low_space`] — preflight checks that fail
//!   early, or merely warn, with required-vs-available amounts.
//! * [`map_write_error`] — maps [`std::io::ErrorKind::StorageFull`] to a clear
//!   user-facing message instead of the raw OS error, and
//!   [`subprocess_full_disk_error`] does the same for a helper process such as
//!   `tar`, whose out-of-space failure arrives as stderr text.
//!
//! Free space is only reported when the filesystem holding the path can be
//! identified with confidence: the platform's mount list is incomplete, so a
//! device-ID cross-check rejects a mount that merely looks like an ancestor.
//! An unidentifiable filesystem reports [`SpaceCheck::Unknown`], which never
//! blocks an operation — reporting another filesystem's free space would
//! refuse a valid install with a confident wrong number.
//!
//! Hard failure is reserved for *exact* requirements (a known download size).
//! Estimated requirements (extraction, which depends on the compression ratio)
//! only warn: a false refusal that blocks a valid install is worse than a late
//! failure.
