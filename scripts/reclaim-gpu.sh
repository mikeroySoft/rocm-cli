# Reclaim the GPU from E2E processes leaked by a killed or timed-out prior run,
# whose Drop teardown never executed.
#
# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT INLINE `pkill -f`: the inline version anchored each
# pattern to a scenario temp dir (`/tmp/rocm-e2e`) or the shared *cache*
# (`e2e-shared`), but a managed serve runs the engine binary out of the shared
# *pre-warm runtime* tree — `$RUNNER_WORKSPACE/e2e-prewarm-*/data/runtimes/...`
# — which matched neither. `pkill -f` also matches the whole command line in
# order, and argv[0] is the binary path, so a `/tmp/rocm-e2e-*` model argument
# appearing later could not rescue those patterns either. A leaked llama-server
# was therefore invisible to reclaim and held the card until the runner itself
# was replaced, failing every later job on that runner at the GPU preflight.
#
# That is why a miss here is expensive rather than merely untidy: on the
# container lanes the pod is usually fresh per job, but the work volume is not
# and two jobs can share one pod's life — so a single leak the reclaim cannot
# match poisons every job scheduled to that runner until the pod is recreated.
#
# The rule here is order-independent and covers every E2E-owned tree: a process
# is reclaimed when its command line names an E2E root AND an engine/serve
# process. Both halves are required, which is what spares a legitimate
# `/workload` manual-testing serve on a shared self-hosted runner in the
# ordinary case: it names no E2E root, so the root half does not hold.
#
# That is a narrowing, NOT a guarantee, and it is stated here rather than only
# in WHAT THE ANCHORING DOES AND DOES NOT BUY below, because a reader who stops
# at this paragraph is the operator deciding whether their own serve is safe. A
# `/workload` serve IS selected when its command line happens to name a root in
# an argument — `--model-path /home/dev/e2e-shared-models/x.gguf` is the
# measured case. Read that section before relying on this one.

#   /tmp/rocm-e2e   per-scenario temp dirs (plus the TMPDIR-derived form below)
#   e2e-shared      E2E_SHARED_CACHE_DIR (models, HF weights)
#   e2e-prewarm     E2E_SHARED_RUNTIMES_DIR — the pre-warmed runtime tree the
#                   engine binaries actually live in
#   e2e-target      CARGO_TARGET_DIR for the suite's own binaries
#
# The scenario root stays ABSOLUTE, and follows TMPDIR.
#
# Scenario dirs come from `TempDir::with_prefix("rocm-e2e-")`, which builds on
# `std::env::temp_dir()` and so follows TMPDIR; the nightly Strix lane redirects
# it to `$HOME/actions-runner/tmp`. A bare `/tmp/rocm-e2e` kept matching there
# only by accident — that directory is itself named `tmp`, so the substring
# still appeared — and would silently stop matching under any redirect not
# named `tmp`. Deriving the redirected form fixes that for ANY target.
#
# WHAT THE ANCHORING DOES AND DOES NOT BUY. Roots are matched as unanchored
# substrings of the WHOLE command line, so any root also matches a process that
# merely mentions it in an ARGUMENT. The bare segment `rocm-e2e` — what both
# PowerShell mirrors use — makes that trivially reachable: a hand-run
# `--hf-repo myorg/rocm-e2e-baseline-7b` on a shared runner is selected and
# SIGKILLed. Measured, and briefly shipped, which is why it is spelled out.
#
# Anchoring the scenario root to an absolute path NARROWS that surface. It does
# not close it, and the `/workload` narrowing stated at the top of this file is
# correspondingly weaker than it would read on its own:
#
#   - under a redirected TMPDIR, an argument naming a sibling path still
#     matches — `--extra-data-dir /tmp/mydir/rocm-e2e-notes` with
#     TMPDIR=/tmp/mydir;
#   - the three segment roots are NOT anchored at all, and "shared" and "target"
#     are ordinary words. `--model-path /home/dev/e2e-shared-models/x.gguf` and
#     `--served-model-name e2e-target-vs-baseline` are both selected today.
#
# Both predate this script and neither is fixed here; closing them properly
# means matching on a path boundary rather than a substring, across the bash
# rule and both mirrors together. Stated rather than implied, because an earlier
# revision of this comment claimed these roots "name directories no argument
# plausibly carries" — which is false, and is the same overclaim that made the
# bare-segment change look safe.

# Read a process's command line, NUL-separated in /proc, as a single string.
# Fails when the process is gone or its command line is empty (a kernel thread,
# or a zombie whose argv has already been released).
#
# NEWLINE is flattened along with the NUL separators the kernel inserted,
# because it is the record terminator `select_leaked` emits and `reclaim` reads
# back. A newline INSIDE an argv element is content, not a separator, and
# `--chat-template` or `--prompt` can carry one. Left intact, such a process
# emits a record that splits into two on the way back: the real pid arrives
# carrying a truncated command line, fails the identity check against its own
# full one, and is reported "recycled ... not signalling" — so the leak survives
# both TERM and KILL while the summary prints "0 process(es) signalled". That is
# the silent miss this whole script exists to end, so it is fixed at the single
# point every consumer already reads through rather than at each of them.
#
# The TAB is deliberately NOT flattened, though it is the field separator. It
# does not need to be, measured rather than reasoned:
#
#   record   "<pid>\t/path/llama-server --tmpl a\tb "
#   read -r pid cmdline  ->  pid=[<pid>]  cmdline=[/path/llama-server --tmpl a\tb ]
#
# `read` gives leftover words AND their intervening separators to the LAST name,
# so a tab EMBEDDED in the command line lands in `cmdline` verbatim. Separators
# are stripped only where the assigned field BEGINS or ENDS with them, and BOTH
# edges are ruled out here — each by its own property, so both are named:
#
#   - leading: the command line starts with argv[0], a path, so the trailing
#     field never begins with a separator. (Were it to, a leading tab WOULD be
#     stripped: `IFS=$'\t' read -r pid cmdline <<<$'1\t\tx'` yields `x`.)
#   - trailing: /proc/<pid>/cmdline ends in a NUL for every process as execve
#     left it — every engine this rule matches — and flattening that NUL
#     leaves a trailing space, so a tab is never the last byte. This one is
#     load-bearing and measured — with the trailing space `…arg\t ` survives
#     intact, without it the same tab is stripped. The same property is relied
#     on again at the self-test's record check; if it ever changes, both move
#     together.
#
#     Not every process, though. One that rewrites its argv AND environment
#     with no NUL left in either (setproctitle taken to the limit) gets a
#     cmdline with no terminator at all — measured, it can end in a tab. The
#     tab is then stripped, the identity check below fails, and the pid is
#     reported "recycled" and not signalled: a miss, never a wrong kill.
#
# An earlier revision also claimed the tab "shifts the field boundary" and
# flattened it for that reason — also false, and deleting the tab from the
# flattening set failed no check in this file. Flattening it anyway would have
# coarsened the identity comparison below for nothing.
#
# Matching is unaffected either way: no root or marker contains a newline. The
# identity comparison in same_selected_process is coarsened only for the newline
# — two command lines differing ONLY in a newline-versus-space at one position
# now read as equal. Both sides come through here, so they are flattened alike.
# That is a real cost, weighed against a silent miss any engine invocation
# carrying a prompt can reach.
#

# right, so `<file 2>/dev/null` still lets the shell's own "No such file" reach

  #    is the only place that says so:
  #
  #    - a NEWLINE in an argv element splits one record into two. The genuine pid
  #      then arrives with a TRUNCATED command line, fails the identity check
  #      against its own full one, and is passed over as "recycled": the leak
  #      survives TERM and KILL alike while the run signs off with "0 process(es)
  #      signalled". cmdline_of flattens it for that reason, and deleting that
  #      flattening fails this check.
  #    - a TAB does NOT, even though it is the field separator, because `read`
  #      hands leftover separators to the last name and the trailing space left
  #      by the final NUL keeps a tab from ever being stripped as a trailing one.
  #      cmdline_of deliberately leaves it alone; see the reasoning there.
  #
  #    The tab fixture therefore guards the FORMAT, not the flattening: it is
  #    what fails if the record shape is ever changed to something a tab can
  #    break. Asserting it as though it pinned a flattening step would be a claim
  #    of coverage that no mutation can falsify, which is how this check read
  #    before — it announced the tab as individually asserted while deleting the
  #    tab from the flattening set left every check green.
  #
  #    Placed HERE, ahead of containment, deliberately. A split record also
  #    trips check 7's escape loop — its continuation line names no scratch
  #    tree — which arms the gate and returns before checks 8-11 ever run. The
  #    run is red either way; what this adds is the true cause, printed before
  #    the one check 7 would otherwise report in its place.
  # Read RAW, flattening only the kernel's NUL separators: cmdline_of flattens
  # the newline, so asking it would report the fixture carries one no matter what
  # the decoy was actually given.
  # Counted apart from the record loop below, for the same reason check 7 keeps
  # its empty-selection count separate: these say the FIXTURE is unusable, the

  # affirm the second while the first has just been denied.

  #    issue are still real, which is what makes the survival loop meaningful.
