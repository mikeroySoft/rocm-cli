# AGENTS: Safe OSS Contribution Workflow For rocm-cli

Use this workflow for any upstream-facing work — PRs, issues, review replies, or public-fork branches — in this or any other public repository.
This is a blocking requirement before upstream-facing activity.

## 0) Activation And Scope

Activate this workflow before any of these actions:

- opening or editing an upstream PR
- opening or editing an upstream issue
- posting or editing an upstream comment or review reply
- pushing a branch intended for upstream

This workflow adds OSS safety and verification guardrails on top of normal dev flow.

## 1) Core Operating Rules

- Solve the reported problem, not an adjacent symptom.
- Be explicit about what is verified versus assumed.
- Never silently skip verification; if a check cannot run, state it clearly.
- Surface options and tradeoffs when multiple approaches are valid.
- Require explicit user approval for high-blast-radius actions:
  - force-pushes
  - opening/closing/merging PRs
  - public comments/review replies
  - changes to shared or public state

## 2) Company Identity Required, Internal Content Forbidden

Identity requirements stay intact:

- use your employer's author/committer identity (when required)
- include DCO sign-off (`git commit -s`)
- keep commit signing enabled when configured; do not bypass with `--no-gpg-sign`, `-n`, or `--no-verify`

Signing and sign-off are now **enforced**, not just policy: local prek hooks
check signing config on every commit (`commit-signing-configured`) and verify
the full range on push (`verify-commits`), and a blocking CI gate
(`commit-signatures`) re-checks every PR with GitHub "Verified" status. See
`docs/commit-signatures.md`.

Content restrictions for upstream surfaces:

- do not include internal/proprietary names, aliases, URLs, hostnames, gateways, cluster names, or registry paths
- do not include links to internal tracking systems or unrelated internal usernames
- bare Jira/EAI-style ticket IDs (e.g. `EAI-1234`) are permitted anywhere this rule applies; do not flag them
- apply this rule to PR titles/bodies, issue text, comments, review replies, commit messages, branch names, code comments, fixtures, and logs

Use neutral external framing (for example: "backend" or "gateway") rather than internal or vendor-specific ownership phrasing.

Leak scan before each upstream push/PR/comment batch:

```bash
INTERNAL_KEYWORDS_PATTERN='internal|confidential|proprietary|private|jira|confluence|\.corp|\.internal'
git diff <upstream-base>..HEAD \
  | grep -inE "$INTERNAL_KEYWORDS_PATTERN" \
  && echo "REVIEW each hit" || echo "diff clean"
```

This default pattern is intentionally generic so the workflow runs as-is. Refine `INTERNAL_KEYWORDS_PATTERN` with your organization's internal names and systems. Also manually review non-diff text surfaces (PR body, comments, issue text, branch name).

## 3) Reproduce First, Then Fix The Actual Issue

- reproduce the reported issue before claiming root cause or fix
- verify that the same reproduction passes after the change
- test boundary paths (non-default config, larger inputs, alternate trigger paths)
- do not relabel an adjacent improvement as "the fix" if the original repro still fails

Every bug fix ships with a regression test in the same change:

- test fails before fix and passes after fix
- choose unit/integration/e2e level based on where the bug lives
- if an e2e cannot run in default CI, state the gap in PR text and cover at another CI level

**User-observable behavior needs a scenario, not only a unit test.** This applies to
features as well as fixes. If the change alters what a user of the CLI can observe —
command output, exit codes, files or paths the CLI creates, or which runtime/engine it
selects — then that behavior must be covered by a Gherkin scenario in
`tests/e2e-cucumber/features/`, adding or updating the scenario and its step
definitions when no existing scenario already covers it:

- a unit test asserting the internal helper does NOT discharge this; it proves the
  function, not the behavior
- if a scenario for the behavior already exists, say in the PR text which `@id:` it is
  and that the change makes it pass — do not silently rely on it
- if the scenario can only run on a gated lane (`@requires-gpu`, `@nightly`), say so in
  the PR text and name the lane that will exercise it
- purely internal changes (refactors, CI plumbing, docs) do not need one; say why in the
  PR text rather than leaving it unexplained

**A message about the CLI's own behavior is asserted together with the behavior.** When a
change adds or edits a line the CLI prints about what it just did, what it will do next,
or what the user must do to recover, the covering test asserts the message *and* the
resulting state in the same test. Three shapes need this:

- claims of an outcome ("this becomes the active default runtime", "nothing was saved")
- remediation advice naming a command — the named command must exist, accept those flags,
  and actually clear the condition that printed it
- promises that something will *not* happen ("no driver commands will be executed",
  "never stops servers automatically"), which no happy-path test exercises

A test that only pins the wording certifies the string, not the truth of it, and a pin
over a false claim holds the claim in place. Where the text genuinely has to be pinned on
its own, the assertion carries a comment naming the test that proves the behavior — see
`setup_reset_cli_output_is_plain_and_persists_first_time_prompt` in `apps/rocm/src/main.rs`,
which pins the onboarding line and points at
`startup_focus_gate_only_opens_onboarding_for_explicit_setup_focus` for the behavior
itself.

The message and the code it describes are usually in different functions and often
different files, so nothing links them by construction. Where the printed line can be
derived from the same value the branch is taken on — as `preapproved_install_line` in
`apps/rocm/src/therock.rs` derives it from the approval source — prefer that: a message
computed from the decision cannot disagree with it.

## 4) Live State Verification Before Any External Claim

Before each stateful decision or public status update:

- refresh remote state (`git fetch`)
- re-check PR status and checks with live `gh` queries
- verify review context against current PR head commit

Do not rely on stale memory, partial CI views, or prior snapshots.
Subagent reports are hypotheses until directly re-verified. When re-verifying, match the verification scope to the claim: if subagent claimed "tests pass", re-run the same test suite; if it claimed "no conflicts", do the rebase locally; if it claimed "leak-free", re-run the scan. A passing unit test asserting exact string content only proves the string is unchanged, not that the claim is true — re-derive the claim against the actual code path rather than accepting the test as proof.

After rebase/cherry-pick/merge, grep for conflict markers:

```bash
grep -rn "^<<<<<<<\|^=======\|^>>>>>>>" .
```

For leak scans, use upstream base `origin/main` (or upstream default branch if different):

```bash
INTERNAL_KEYWORDS_PATTERN='internal|confidential|proprietary|private|jira|confluence|\.corp|\.internal'
git diff origin/main..HEAD \
  | grep -inE "$INTERNAL_KEYWORDS_PATTERN" \
  && echo "REVIEW each hit" || echo "diff clean"
```

Planning and scratch artifacts are not repository documentation. Keep `plans/`,
implementation logs, and agent working notes out of commits; durable design
documentation belongs under `docs/`.

## 5) Investigate rocm-cli Before Editing

Understand existing patterns first:

- contributor and behavior docs in `README.md`, `docs/`, and `skills/`
- workspace topology from `Cargo.toml`
- sibling implementations in `apps/`, `crates/`, and `engines/`
- existing tests and conventions in `docs/testing.md`

Fix at the correct layer (root cause), not by shrinking symptom visibility.
If approach choice is ambiguous, present alternatives and recommend one.

Keep docs and behavior claims in sync while editing:

- when a command's flags, defaults, arguments, or observable behavior
  change, update README.md, its --help/doc comment, docs/testing.md, and
  docs/manual-testing.md in the same change — do not leave user-facing docs
  for a follow-up
- the same behavior claim (e.g. "does X automatically") often repeats across
  README.md, --help doc comments, printed CLI output, and docs/*.md; each
  drifts independently, so grep for the claim's wording across all of them,
  not just the surface you're editing, and check each against the actual
  code path

## 6) rocm-cli Architecture Guardrails

Current workspace members:

- apps: `apps/rocm`, `apps/rocmd`
- shared crates: `crates/rocm-core`, `crates/rocm-engine-protocol`
- engine crates: `engines/lemonade`, `engines/vllm`

Shared UI components — reuse rather than hand-rolling new ones:
`apps/rocm/src/cli_progress.rs`'s `Spinner` for a caller-driven indicator that
only advances when the caller's own loop ticks it (e.g. `serve`'s
HTTP-polling wait loop); that same file's `AnimatedSpinner` for progress that
must keep animating between caller updates, which can go quiet for long
stretches (e.g. a download or the ComfyUI/SDK extraction spinner); and
`crates/rocm-dash-tui/src/ui/approval.rs` for approval-state prompts.

Guardrails:

- new subsystems/subcommands: default their domain implementation to its own file from day one (full domain extraction, e.g. `therock.rs`/`comfyui.rs` — private `mod` in `apps/rocm`, accessed via qualified paths; the clap command enum and its dispatch function usually stay in `main.rs`, though not always — see `docs/architecture.md`'s `bootstrap.rs` note), not growth inside `main.rs`/`lib.rs` awaiting a future extraction pass; see `docs/architecture.md` for the module map and the mechanical-relocation alternative used for dispatch-adjacent clusters
- `crates/rocm-engine-protocol` is a contract surface; verify all impacted engines after protocol changes
- first-party crate-layering invariants (e.g. `rocmd` must never depend on `rocm`) are enforced by `cargo xtask check-crate-edges` (`xtask/src/crate_edges.rs`); a new first-party dependency edge failing that check means the edge needs review, not a bypass
- preserve strict GPU-required behavior; do not introduce silent CPU fallback
- respect platform gates (for example, native Windows handling for vLLM)
- pin third-party GitHub Actions to a full commit SHA with a trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment, never a moving tag (`@v2`, `@main`); a retagged or compromised action otherwise enters CI silently. Bump the SHA and comment together when upgrading
- before hand-rolling CLI output (completion reports, progress/spinner indicators, confirmation/approval prompts), check for and reuse the existing shared components (e.g. `apps/rocm/src/cli_report.rs::ActionReport`) instead of duplicating the pattern inline; extend the shared component if it doesn't yet cover the needed case
- supported host platforms are Windows and Linux only (including WSL where documented)
- platforms outside Windows/Linux are unsupported; do not implement, debug, or "fix" unsupported-platform behavior
  - if a test fails only on unsupported platforms (e.g., macOS), skip or mark as out of scope; do not alter logic to make it pass
  - add a comment documenting why the test is skipped (e.g., `#[cfg_attr(not(target_os = "linux"), ignore)]`)

## 7) Local Assistant And Tool-Use Policy Consistency

When changing assistant-adjacent behavior, keep consistency with:

- `docs/llm-tool-use.md`
- `skills/rocm-cli-assistant/SKILL.md`
- `skills/rocm-doctor/SKILL.md` and `skills/rocm-doctor/reference.md`

Required consistency points:

- inspect state before proposing mutation
- mutating actions require approval flow
- avoid invented shell/package-manager commands in assistant behavior paths
- preserve built-in assistant constraints and no-CPU-fallback policy

### `skills/rocm-doctor/` — published from here, and a test fixture

`skills/rocm-cli-assistant/SKILL.md` is compiled into the binary
(`include_str!` in `apps/rocm/src/main.rs`). `skills/rocm-doctor/` is different
on two counts, and both change how you edit it:

- **This repo is its source of truth.** The skill is a thin driver over the
  `rocm` binary, so it is versioned with the binary and lives here.
  [`amd/skills`](https://github.com/amd/skills) is still in Phase-1
  incubation for this skill: it carries no automated federation for
  `rocm-doctor` yet — `.github/federation.json` there only declares
  `AMD-AGI/TraceLens` as a source, and this skill instead sits under
  `staging/rocm-doctor`, outside any job's coverage. Until federation picks it
  up, the rocm-cli team hand-syncs `staging/rocm-doctor` from this folder
  whenever it changes materially. So edit it here, and never edit the
  `amd/skills` copy directly — the next hand-sync overwrites it.
- **`reference.md` is an e2e fixture.** `tests/e2e-cucumber/features/rocm_doctor_skill.feature`
  parses its closed-catalog table and compares it to what `rocm fix` reports.
  The failure catalog itself is authoritative in `crates/rocm-core/src/fix.rs`
  (the `RECIPES` list) and `crates/rocm-core/src/diagnose.rs` (each mode's
  checker and OS scoping) — adding, renaming, or re-scoping a failure mode
  means changing the CLI **first**, then the two docs. That feature is what
  catches you if you forget.

The folder is excluded from `licenserc.toml`: `SKILL.md` must open with YAML
frontmatter for the skill loader, and skills published this way carry no
license headers of their own. The licence is stated in `skill-card.md`
instead.

Two checks gate it, and they cover different things:

- **`skill-evals` (skillscope, advisory today)** — the frontmatter an agent
  runtime parses, the `evals/evals.json` coverage bar (at least 3 prompts that
  should trigger the skill and 2 near misses that should not), the
  `skill-card.md` sections, and every internal markdown link. It is not yet a
  required status check in branch protection: an admin must add its exact
  context, `Skill checks (skillscope)` (the job's `name:`, not the
  `skill-evals` job id), before a red run actually blocks a merge. Reproduce
  it locally with
  `uv tool install git+https://github.com/amd/skillscope@v0.1.0`, then
  `skillscope structural --skills-dir 'skills/rocm-doctor' --skill-files
  skill-card.md --skill-sections Description,Owner,License`. Add `--external`
  to check the outbound URLs too; CI does not, because a rate-limited host is
  not a broken link.
- **`rocm_doctor_skill.feature` (e2e, blocking)** — whether the prose still
  describes the binary, as above.

Neither grades whether the skill actually *fires*. That is skillscope's
`routing` and `behavioral`, which need an authenticated `claude` CLI and an
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` this repo does not have. The dataset is written and checked
so those can be switched on without further work.

`skills/rocm-cli-assistant/` is **not** in scope for skillscope: it is embedded
verbatim into the chat system prompt with `include_str!`, so the YAML
frontmatter a published skill needs would end up inside that prompt.

## 8) Verification Matrix For This Repo

Minimum quality gate before upstream-ready status:

```bash
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
python scripts/smoke_local.py
```

When relevant to touched behavior, also run targeted checks from `docs/testing.md`, such as:

- focused Rust test groups for touched modules
- engine-specific GPU self-tests (`--self-test`) or live GPU tests when hardware is available
- release gate checks for release-path changes (`python scripts/single_exe_release_gate.py`)

**Execution environment expectations:**

- By default, tests run on the developer's local machine (Linux or Windows, GPU optional but recommended for engine tests)
- GPU tests must pass on hardware if available locally; otherwise, they are expected to fail gracefully with clear messaging
- CI gates run on dedicated hardware and may have different results than local runs; use CI as the authoritative verification
- If a required check cannot run locally (e.g., GPU not available), say exactly what was not run and why in PR description

## 9) Release Trust And Signing Requirements

For release-affecting changes, follow `docs/release-trust.md`. In brief:

- checksum sidecars are required
- detached signatures are required when release policy mandates them
- do not bypass required signature modes
- preserve metadata/index signature verification behavior when enabled

Production signing and trust roots are owner-controlled inputs; do not substitute ad hoc keys as production trust anchors.

See `docs/release-trust.md` for the full policy, key management, and signing workflows.

## 10) Vendored Upstream Trees

If a vendored upstream tree is introduced in the future, apply the following rules:

- keep vendored changes minimal and attributable
- do not assume root workspace checks cover vendored workspace behavior
- follow sync notes in the appropriate upstream-sync documentation for pin updates and rebuild workflow

## 11) PR/Issue/Review Conduct

- keep each PR scoped to one logical change
- write for maintainers unfamiliar with local context
- avoid AI-generated boilerplate footers
- do not resolve reviewer threads you did not author; reply with fix commit context
- if reviewed code must be updated, explain what changed since review
- automated reviewers (e.g. Copilot) can post new findings on a commit that itself fixed earlier findings; after pushing a fix and replying to the original threads, re-fetch PR comments once more before treating the review round as closed
- to check whether a review comment already has a reply, do not call `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/comments/$id/replies` (GET); it 404s. Fetch the full list (`gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/{pr}/comments --paginate`) and cross-reference each comment's `in_reply_to_id` against other comments' `id`s

**Stacked and dependent PRs:**

- Keep stacked PRs in draft until dependencies merge upstream (i.e., this repo's main branch, not just local)
- After dependencies merge, rebase and move PR out of draft
- Use `git rebase -i` for meaningful commit messages; prefer individual commits over squash unless the PR is a single logical unit
- In PR body, clearly link to dependencies (e.g., "Depends on #123") and reference the target branch

## 12) CI Ownership: Drive To Green

Do not stop at opening/updating a PR.
Watch checks to completion and drive to all-green.

- inspect failing logs directly
- fix real regressions from your change
- handle infrastructure flakes by rerun or maintainer escalation with evidence
- ensure flakes are not hiding real code failures in other checks

A red check means "not ready" until resolved.

## 13) Upstream Pre-flight Checklist

Run this checklist before any upstream push, PR update, issue update, or public reply:

1. Live state refreshed (`git fetch`, fresh PR/check status query) — *§4*
2. Project conventions re-checked for touched area — *§5*
3. Issue reproduced; fix validated against same repro plus boundaries — *§3*
4. Regression test added and passing at the appropriate level — *§3*
5. User-observable behavior covered by a scenario (or its absence justified) — *§3*
6. Required local gates run (or explicitly documented gaps) — *§8*
7. Leak scan completed across diff and non-diff text surfaces — *§2*
8. Employer identity (if required), DCO sign-off, and commit-signing requirements preserved — *§2*
9. Scope remains one logical change at correct layer — *§11*
10. CI watched to completion and driven to green — *§12*
11. User approval obtained for any high-blast-radius external action — *§1*

## 14) Related Internal Workflows

Use existing internal mechanics/workflows for implementation details such as commit, push, rebase, PR operations, and review-and-fix/dev-cycle automation where available.

## 15) Enforcement And Feedback

This workflow is advisory and human-enforced. Violations are addressed through:

- **Pre-push review**: Activate this workflow before pushing; review each step
- **Code review**: Upstream maintainers may request alignment if issues are found
- **CI gates**: Section 8 checks block CI; ensure all pass before opening PR
- **Incident response**: If a leak or policy violation reaches upstream, document the root cause and adjust workflow

This file defines OSS safety, verification, and publication guardrails for rocm-cli.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in the `mikeroySoft/rocm-cli` fork, not the upstream `ROCm/rocm-cli` repository. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles use their default label names. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

This is a single-context repo: use root `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/`, created lazily. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
