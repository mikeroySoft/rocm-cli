//! Reading the local tailnet: which machines exist, and how to address one.
//!
//! Everything here talks to the *local* Tailscale daemon and nothing else. No
//! SSH, no session, no call to a peer — listing candidate machines must not
//! require being able to reach them, or discovery would only ever show you what
//! you already knew how to contact.
//!
//! Two consumers: `rocm remote targets`, which renders the list, and the serve
//! path, which resolves one user-supplied name to a peer. They share a resolver
//! so a name that lists is a name that serves.
//!
//! Authorization is deliberately absent. Which peers a user may reach is the
//! tailnet admin's ACL policy, enforced by Tailscale; this module reports what
//! `tailscale status` already says and passes that tool's failures through
//! unchanged rather than reinterpreting them.
