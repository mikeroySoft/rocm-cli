//! Static contract test: a test that mutates the process environment must
//! serialize itself.
//!
//! Regression guard for EAI-8397. `std::env::set_var`/`remove_var` change state
//! shared by every thread in the process, so two tests touching the same key
//! race — one reads the other's value and fails an assertion that has nothing
//! to do with what it is testing.
//!
//! This is invisible on most of CI. `ci.yml`'s `Test (affected crates)` job
//! runs `cargo nextest` (a process per test, so the mutation cannot escape),
//! but `windows-build-and-test` runs `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` —
//! all tests as threads in ONE process. So the Windows lane, a required check,
//! was the only place the race could fire, and it read as "your change broke
//! Windows" on branches that never touched the crate. Nothing about the bug is
//! Windows-specific; it is a property of the runner.
//!
//! "the Linux lanes use nextest" would be too strong: `coverage`
//! (`cargo llvm-cov`, no `--nextest`) and `e2e` (`cargo test -p e2e-cucumber
//! --lib`) are threaded single-process harnesses on `ubuntu-latest` too. They
//! happen not to reach the crates that raced, which is luck rather than
//! design — so this guard covers the whole tree rather than one crate.
//!
//! The repo already had two ways of handling this — `ScopedTestEnv` in
//! `apps/rocm/src/main.rs` and `PROCESS_ENV_TEST_LOCK` in
//! `apps/rocm/src/therock.rs`, both of which take a process-wide lock — and the
//! `fix.rs` tests that flaked were simply the ones that skipped the discipline.
//! This guard makes the omission a build failure rather than an intermittent
//! red on a required check.
//!
//! Best is to not touch the environment at all: pass the value in through a
//! test seam, as `discover_rocm_installs_on_host_in` and
//! `newest_rocm_install_dir_in` do. Where a test must exercise the real
//! env-reading path, holding one of the shared locks above is the accepted
//! alternative and satisfies this guard.
