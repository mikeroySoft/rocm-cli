//! Will this model run on this machine?
//!
//! `examine` answers what is on the host and `diagnose` answers what went wrong
//! after a failure. This answers the question that comes before both, from data
//! the CLI already has: a curated [`ModelRecipeRecord`] (dtype, quantization,
//! minimum GPU memory, device policy, preferred engines, declared alternatives)
//! composed with what the host can offer. **It fetches nothing** — no weights,
//! no metadata probe, no network call of any kind — which is the whole point:
//! today a user learns a model will not run by starting a download and waiting
//! for it to fail.
//!
//! Three distinctions carry the design, and collapsing any of them produces a
//! confident wrong answer:
//!
//! - A catalog that could not be **read** is not a model that does not **fit**.
//!   [`ModelCatalogSource`] keeps them apart and [`ModelVerdict::Undetermined`]
//!   is where the first one lands.
//! - Memory the CLI **could not measure** is not memory the host **does not
//!   have**. See [`AcceleratorMemory`].
//! - No telemetry at all is not the same gap as telemetry that names the
//!   *wrong pool*: an APU's `amd-smi` reading is real, it just is not the
//!   figure its engine allocates from, and the CLI cannot read that figure
//!   today. Conflating the two hands an APU user a remediation that can never
//!   work. See [`AcceleratorMemory::UnifiedMemoryUnreadable`].
//!
//! Curated recipes only. Answering for an arbitrary hub model needs a metadata
//! probe and a table mapping quantization schemes to available kernels, neither
//! of which has a source of truth here; such a model is reported
//! [`UndeterminedReason::ModelNotCurated`], never blocked.
